AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Dietary fat intake is associated with increased risk of 
      colorectal cancer (CRC). We examined the role of high-fat diet (HFD) in driving 
      CRC through modulating gut microbiota and metabolites. METHODS: HFD or control 
      diet was fed to mice littermates in CRC mouse models of an azoxymethane (AOM) 
      model and Apc(min/+) model, with or without antibiotics cocktail treatment. 
      Germ-free mice for fecal microbiota transplantation were used for validation. Gut 
      microbiota and metabolites were detected using metagenomic sequencing and 
      high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, respectively. Gut 
      barrier function was determined using lipopolysaccharides level and transmission 
      electron microscopy. RESULTS: HFD promoted colorectal tumorigenesis in both 
      AOM-treated mice and Apc(min/+) mice compared with control diet-fed mice. Gut 
      microbiota depletion using antibiotics attenuated colon tumor formation in 
      HFD-fed mice. A significant shift of gut microbiota composition with increased 
      pathogenic bacteria Alistipessp.Marseille-P5997 and Alistipessp.5CPEGH6, and 
      depleted probiotic Parabacteroides distasonis, along with impaired gut barrier 
      function was exhibited in HFD-fed mice. Moreover, HFD-modulated gut microbiota 
      promotes colorectal tumorigenesis in AOM-treated germ-free mice, indicating gut 
      microbiota was essential in HFD-associated colorectal tumorigenesis. Gut 
      metabolites alteration, including elevated lysophosphatidic acid, which was 
      confirmed to promote CRC cell proliferation and impair cell junction, was also 
      observed in HFD-fed mice. Moreover, transfer of stools from HFD-fed mice to 
      germ-free mice without interference increased colonic cell proliferation, 
      impaired gut barrier function, and induced oncogenic genes expression. 
      CONCLUSIONS: HFD drives colorectal tumorigenesis through inducing gut microbial 
      dysbiosis, metabolomic dysregulation with elevated lysophosphatidic acid, and gut 
      barrier dysfunction in mice.

TI  - Metagenomic and metabolomic analyses reveal distinct stage-specific phenotypes of 
      the gut microbiota in colorectal cancer.

AB  - In most cases of sporadic colorectal cancers, tumorigenesis is a multistep 
      process, involving genomic alterations in parallel with morphologic changes. In 
      addition, accumulating evidence suggests that the human gut microbiome is linked 
      to the development of colorectal cancer. Here we performed fecal metagenomic and 
      metabolomic studies on samples from a large cohort of 616 participants who 
      underwent colonoscopy to assess taxonomic and functional characteristics of gut 
      microbiota and metabolites. Microbiome and metabolome shifts were apparent in 
      cases of multiple polypoid adenomas and intramucosal carcinomas, in addition to 
      more advanced lesions. We found two distinct patterns of microbiome elevations. 
      First, the relative abundance of Fusobacterium nucleatum spp. was significantly 
      (P < 0.005) elevated continuously from intramucosal carcinoma to more advanced 
      stages. Second, Atopobium parvulum and Actinomyces odontolyticus, which 
      co-occurred in intramucosal carcinomas, were significantly (P < 0.005) increased 
      only in multiple polypoid adenomas and/or intramucosal carcinomas. Metabolome 
      analyses showed that branched-chain amino acids and phenylalanine were 
      significantly (P < 0.005) increased in intramucosal carcinomas and bile acids, 
      including deoxycholate, were significantly (P < 0.005) elevated in multiple 
      polypoid adenomas and/or intramucosal carcinomas. We identified metagenomic and 
      metabolomic markers to discriminate cases of intramucosal carcinoma from the 
      healthy controls. Our large-cohort multi-omics data indicate that shifts in the 
      microbiome and metabolome occur from the very early stages of the development of 
      colorectal cancer, which is of possible etiological and diagnostic importance.

AB  - Secondary bile acids (SBAs) are derived from primary bile acids (PBAs) in a 
      process reliant on biosynthetic capabilities possessed by few microbes. To 
      evaluate the role of BAs in intestinal inflammation, we performed metabolomic, 
      microbiome, metagenomic, and transcriptomic profiling of stool from ileal pouches 
      (surgically created resevoirs) in colectomy-treated patients with ulcerative 
      colitis (UC) versus controls (familial adenomatous polyposis [FAP]). We show that 
      relative to FAP, UC pouches have reduced levels of lithocholic acid and 
      deoxycholic acid (normally the most abundant gut SBAs), genes required to convert 
      PBAs to SBAs, and Ruminococcaceae (one of few taxa known to include SBA-producing 
      bacteria). In three murine colitis models, SBA supplementation reduces intestinal 
      inflammation. This anti-inflammatory effect is in part dependent on the TGR5 bile 
      acid receptor. These data suggest that dysbiosis induces SBA deficiency in 
      inflammatory-prone UC patients, which promotes a pro-inflammatory state within 
      the intestine that may be treated by SBA restoration.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To profile gut microbiome-associated metabolites in serum and 
      investigate whether these metabolites could distinguish individuals with 
      colorectal cancer (CRC) or adenoma from normal healthy individuals. DESIGN: 
      Integrated analysis of untargeted serum metabolomics by liquid 
      chromatography-mass spectrometry and metagenome sequencing of paired faecal 
      samples was applied to identify gut microbiome-associated metabolites with 
      significantly altered abundance in patients with CRC and adenoma. The ability of 
      these metabolites to discriminate between CRC and colorectal adenoma was tested 
      by targeted metabolomic analysis. A model based on gut microbiome-associated 
      metabolites was established and evaluated in an independent validation cohort. 
      RESULTS: In total, 885 serum metabolites were significantly altered in both CRC 
      and adenoma, including eight gut microbiome-associated serum metabolites (GMSM 
      panel) that were reproducibly detected by both targeted and untargeted 
      metabolomics analysis and accurately discriminated CRC and adenoma from normal 
      samples. A GMSM panel-based model to predict CRC and colorectal adenoma yielded 
      an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.98 (95% CI 0.94 to 1.00) in the modelling 
      cohort and an AUC of 0.92 (83.5% sensitivity, 84.9% specificity) in the 
      validation cohort. The GMSM model was significantly superior to the clinical 
      marker carcinoembryonic antigen among samples within the validation cohort (AUC 
      0.92 vs 0.72) and also showed promising diagnostic accuracy for adenomas 
      (AUC=0.84) and early-stage CRC (AUC=0.93). CONCLUSION: Gut microbiome 
      reprogramming in patients with CRC is associated with alterations of the serum 
      metabolome, and GMSMs have potential applications for CRC and adenoma detection.

AB  - The incidence of sporadic young-onset colorectal cancer (yCRC) is increasing. A 
      significant knowledge gap exists in the gut microbiota and its diagnostic value 
      for yCRC patients. Through 16S rRNA gene sequencing, 728 samples are collected to 
      identify microbial markers, and an independent cohort of 310 samples is used to 
      validate the results. Furthermore, species-level and functional analysis are 
      performed by metagenome sequencing using 200 samples. Gut microbial diversity is 
      increased in yCRC. Flavonifractor plautii is an important bacterial species in 
      yCRC, while genus Streptococcus contains the key phylotype in the old-onset 
      colorectal cancer. Functional analysis reveals that yCRC has unique 
      characteristics of bacterial metabolism characterized by the dominance of DNA 
      binding and RNA-dependent DNA biosynthetic process. The random forest classifier 
      model achieves a powerful classification potential. This study highlights the 
      potential of the gut microbiota biomarkers as a promising non-invasive tool for 
      the accurate detection and distinction of individuals with yCRC.

TI  - Streptococcus thermophilus Inhibits Colorectal Tumorigenesis Through Secreting 
      β-Galactosidase.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Streptococcus thermophilus was identified to be depleted in 
      patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) by shotgun metagenomic sequencing of 526 
      multicohort fecal samples. Here, we aim to investigate whether this bacterium 
      could act as a prophylactic for CRC prevention. METHODS: The antitumor effects of 
      S thermophilus were assessed in cultured colonic epithelial cells and in 2 murine 
      models of intestinal tumorigenesis. The tumor-suppressive protein produced by S 
      thermophilus was identified by mass spectrometry and followed by β-galactosidase 
      activity assay. The mutant strain of S thermophilus was constructed by homologous 
      recombination. The effect of S thermophilus on the gut microbiota composition was 
      assessed by shotgun metagenomic sequencing. RESULTS: Oral gavage of S 
      thermophilus significantly reduced tumor formation in both Apc(min/+) and 
      azoxymethane-injected mice. Coincubation with S thermophilus or its conditioned 
      medium decreased the proliferation of cultured CRC cells. β-Galactosidase was 
      identified as the critical protein produced by S thermophilus by mass 
      spectrometry screening and β-galactosidase activity assay. β-Galactosidase 
      secreted by S thermophilus inhibited cell proliferation, lowered colony 
      formation, induced cell cycle arrest, and promoted apoptosis of cultured CRC 
      cells and retarded the growth of CRC xenograft. The mutant S thermophilus without 
      functional β-galactosidase lost its tumor-suppressive effect. Also, S 
      thermophilus increased the gut abundance of known probiotics, including 
      Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus via β-galactosidase. β-Galactosidase-dependent 
      production of galactose interfered with energy homeostasis to activate oxidative 
      phosphorylation and downregulate the Hippo pathway kinases, which partially 
      mediated the anticancer effects of S thermophilus. CONCLUSION: S thermophilus is 
      a novel prophylactic for CRC prevention in mice. The tumor-suppressive effect of 
      S thermophilus is mediated at least by the secretion of β-galactosidase.

AB  - Microbial dysbiosis is a colorectal cancer (CRC) hallmark and contributes to 
      inflammation, tumor growth, and therapy response. Gut microbes signal via 
      metabolites, but how the metabolites impact CRC is largely unknown. We 
      interrogated fecal metabolites associated with mouse models of colon 
      tumorigenesis with varying mutational load. We find that microbial metabolites 
      from healthy mice or humans are growth-repressive, and this response is 
      attenuated in mice and patients with CRC. Microbial profiling reveals that 
      Lactobacillus reuteri and its metabolite, reuterin, are downregulated in mouse 
      and human CRC. Reuterin alters redox balance, and reduces proliferation and 
      survival in colon cancer cells. Reuterin induces selective protein oxidation and 
      inhibits ribosomal biogenesis and protein translation. Exogenous Lactobacillus 
      reuteri restricts colon tumor growth, increases tumor reactive oxygen species, 
      and decreases protein translation in vivo. Our findings indicate that a healthy 
      microbiome and specifically, Lactobacillus reuteri, is protective against CRC 
      through microbial metabolite exchange.

AB  - Colorectal cancer, a commonly diagnosed cancer in the elderly, often develops 
      slowly from benign polyps called adenoma. The gut microbiota is believed to be 
      directly involved in colorectal carcinogenesis. The identity and functional 
      capacity of the adenoma- or carcinoma-related gut microbe(s), however, have not 
      been surveyed in a comprehensive manner. Here we perform a metagenome-wide 
      association study (MGWAS) on stools from advanced adenoma and carcinoma patients 
      and from healthy subjects, revealing microbial genes, strains and functions 
      enriched in each group. An analysis of potential risk factors indicates that high 
      intake of red meat relative to fruits and vegetables appears to associate with 
      outgrowth of bacteria that might contribute to a more hostile gut environment. 
      These findings suggest that faecal microbiome-based strategies may be useful for 
      early diagnosis and treatment of colorectal adenoma or carcinoma.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colorectal cancer (CRC) are heterogeneous 
      intestinal diseases that threaten the health of an increasing number of 
      individuals as their lifestyles become westernized. New insights have been 
      discovered with the development of various omics techniques, revealing that 
      gut-microbiota-derived metabolites play important roles in maintaining intestinal 
      homeostasis and modulating the progression of intestinal diseases from both 
      metabolic and immunological perspectives. Clinical metagenomic and metabolomic 
      studies have revealed links between microbial bile acid (BA) metabolism and IBD 
      and CRC progression. Several BA-derived metabolites were recently been 
      demonstrated to play a role in intestinal immunity, providing fresh insights into 
      how BAs affect the course of IBD and CRC. In this review, we discuss recent 
      studies on the involvement of gut microbiota-derived BAs in intestinal immunity, 
      inflammation, and tumorigenesis along with human omics data to provide 
      prospective insights into future prevention and treatment of IBD and CRC.

AB  - Association studies have linked microbiome alterations with many human diseases. 
      However, they have not always reported consistent results, thereby necessitating 
      cross-study comparisons. Here, a meta-analysis of eight geographically and 
      technically diverse fecal shotgun metagenomic studies of colorectal cancer (CRC, 
      n = 768), which was controlled for several confounders, identified a core set of 
      29 species significantly enriched in CRC metagenomes (false discovery rate 
      (FDR) < 1 × 10(-5)). CRC signatures derived from single studies maintained their 
      accuracy in other studies. By training on multiple studies, we improved detection 
      accuracy and disease specificity for CRC. Functional analysis of CRC metagenomes 
      revealed enriched protein and mucin catabolism genes and depleted carbohydrate 
      degradation genes. Moreover, we inferred elevated production of secondary bile 
      acids from CRC metagenomes, suggesting a metabolic link between cancer-associated 
      gut microbes and a fat- and meat-rich diet. Through extensive validations, this 
      meta-analysis firmly establishes globally generalizable, predictive taxonomic and 
      functional microbiome CRC signatures as a basis for future diagnostics.

AB  - Dysbiosis of the gut microbiome has been associated with the development of 
      colorectal cancer (CRC). Gut microbiota is involved in the metabolic 
      transformations of dietary components into oncometabolites and tumor-suppressive 
      metabolites that in turn affect CRC development. In a healthy colon, the major of 
      microbial metabolism is saccharolytic fermentation pathways. The alpha-bug 
      hypothesis suggested that oncogenic bacteria such as enterotoxigenic Bacteroides 
      fragilis (ETBF) induce the development of CRC through direct interactions with 
      colonic epithelial cells and alterations of microbiota composition at the 
      colorectal site. Escherichia coli, E. faecalis, F. nucleatum, and Streptococcus 
      gallolyticus showed higher abundance whereas Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, 
      Faecalibacterium, and Roseburia showed reduced abundance in CRC patients. The 
      alterations of gut microbiota may be used as potential therapeutic approaches to 
      prevent or treat CRC. Probiotics such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium 
      inhibit the growth of CRC through inhibiting inflammation and angiogenesis and 
      enhancing the function of the intestinal barrier through the secretion of 
      short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Crosstalk between lifestyle, host genetics, and 
      gut microbiota is well documented in the prevention and treatment of CRC. Future 
      studies are required to understand the interaction between gut microbiota and 
      host to the influence and prevention of CRC. However, a better understanding of 
      bacterial dysbiosis in the heterogeneity of CRC tumors should also be considered. 
      Metatranscriptomic and metaproteomic studies are considered a powerful omic tool 
      to understand the anti-cancer properties of certain bacterial strains. The 
      clinical benefits of probiotics in the CRC context remain to be determined. 
      Metagenomic approaches along with metabolomics and immunology will open a new 
      avenue for the treatment of CRC shortly. Dietary interventions may be suitable to 
      modulate the growth of beneficial microbiota in the gut.

PG  - 3141-3155

AB  - BACKGROUND: Based on recent research reports, dysbiosis and improper 
      concentrations of microbial metabolites in the gut may result into the 
      carcinogenesis of colorectal cancer. Recent advancement also highlights the 
      involvement of bacteria and their secreted metabolites in the cancer causation. 
      Gut microbial metabolites are functional output of the host-microbiota 
      interactions and produced by anaerobic fermentation of food components in the 
      diet. They contribute to influence variety of biological mechanisms including 
      inflammation, cell signaling, cell-cycle disruption which are majorly disrupted 
      in carcinogenic activities. PURPOSE: In this review, we intend to discuss recent 
      updates and possible molecular mechanisms to provide the role of bacterial 
      metabolites, gut bacteria and diet in the colorectal carcinogenesis. Recent 
      evidences have proposed the role of bacteria, such as Fusobacterium nucleaturm, 
      Streptococcus bovis, Helicobacter pylori, Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium 
      septicum, in the carcinogenesis of CRC. Metagenomic study confirmed that these 
      bacteria are in increased abundance in CRC patient as compared to healthy 
      individuals and can cause inflammation and DNA damage which can lead to 
      development of cancer. These bacteria produce metabolites, such as secondary bile 
      salts from primary bile salts, hydrogen sulfide, trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), 
      which are likely to promote inflammation and subsequently cancer development. 
      CONCLUSION: Recent studies suggest that gut microbiota-derived metabolites have a 
      role in CRC progression and causation and hence, could be implicated in CRC 
      diagnosis, prognosis and therapy.

TI  - Metagenomic analysis of colorectal cancer datasets identifies cross-cohort 
      microbial diagnostic signatures and a link with choline degradation.
PG  - 667-678
LID - 10.1038/s41591-019-0405-7 [doi]
AB  - Several studies have investigated links between the gut microbiome and colorectal 
      cancer (CRC), but questions remain about the replicability of biomarkers across 
      cohorts and populations. We performed a meta-analysis of five publicly available 
      datasets and two new cohorts and validated the findings on two additional 
      cohorts, considering in total 969 fecal metagenomes. Unlike microbiome shifts 
      associated with gastrointestinal syndromes, the gut microbiome in CRC showed 
      reproducibly higher richness than controls (P < 0.01), partially due to 
      expansions of species typically derived from the oral cavity. Meta-analysis of 
      the microbiome functional potential identified gluconeogenesis and the 
      putrefaction and fermentation pathways as being associated with CRC, whereas the 
      stachyose and starch degradation pathways were associated with controls. 
      Predictive microbiome signatures for CRC trained on multiple datasets showed 
      consistently high accuracy in datasets not considered for model training and 
      independent validation cohorts (average area under the curve, 0.84). Pooled 
      analysis of raw metagenomes showed that the choline trimethylamine-lyase gene was 
      overabundant in CRC (P = 0.001), identifying a relationship between microbiome 
      choline metabolism and CRC. The combined analysis of heterogeneous CRC cohorts 
      thus identified reproducible microbiome biomarkers and accurate 
      disease-predictive models that can form the basis for clinical prognostic tests 
      and hypothesis-driven mechanistic studies.

AB  - Sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC) is a result of complex interactions between the 
      host and its environment. Environmental stressors act by causing host cell DNA 
      alterations implicated in the onset of cancer. Here we investigate the stressor 
      ability of CRC-associated gut dysbiosis as causal agent of host DNA alterations. 
      The epigenetic nature of these alterations was investigated in humans and in 
      mice. Germ-free mice receiving fecal samples from subjects with normal 
      colonoscopy or from CRC patients were monitored for 7 or 14 wk. Aberrant crypt 
      foci, luminal microbiota, and DNA alterations (colonic exome sequencing and 
      methylation patterns) were monitored following human feces transfer. 
      CRC-associated microbiota induced higher numbers of hypermethylated genes in 
      murine colonic mucosa (vs. healthy controls' microbiota recipients). Several gene 
      promoters including SFRP1,2,3, PENK, NPY, ALX4, SEPT9, and WIF1 promoters were 
      found hypermethylated in CRC but not in normal tissues or effluents from fecal 
      donors. In a pilot study (n = 266), the blood methylation levels of 3 genes 
      (Wif1, PENK, and NPY) were shown closely associated with CRC dysbiosis. In a 
      validation study (n = 1,000), the cumulative methylation index (CMI) of these 
      genes was significantly higher in CRCs than in controls. Further, CMI appeared as 
      an independent risk factor for CRC diagnosis as shown by multivariate analysis 
      that included fecal immunochemical blood test. Consequently, fecal bacterial 
      species in individuals with higher CMI in blood were identified by whole 
      metagenomic analysis. Thus, CRC-related dysbiosis induces methylation of host 
      genes, and corresponding CMIs together with associated bacteria are potential 
      biomarkers for CRC.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Alterations in the intestinal microbiota affect development of 
      colorectal cancer and drug metabolism. We studied whether the intestinal 
      microbiota affect the ability of aspirin to reduce colon tumor development in 
      mice. METHODS: We performed studies with APC(min/+) mice and mice given 
      azoxymethane and dextran sulfate sodium to induce colorectal carcinogenesis. Some 
      mice were given antibiotics to deplete intestinal microbes, with or without 
      aspirin, throughout the entire experiment. Germ-free mice were studied in 
      validation experiments. Colon tissues were collected and analyzed by 
      histopathology, quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, and 
      immunoblots. Blood samples and gut luminal contents were analyzed by liquid 
      chromatography/mass spectrometry and an arylesterase activity assay. Fecal 
      samples were analyzed by 16S ribosomal RNA gene and shotgun metagenome 
      sequencing. RESULTS: Administration of aspirin to mice reduced colorectal tumor 
      number and load in APC(min/+) mice and mice given azoxymethane and dextran 
      sulfate sodium that had been given antibiotics (depleted gut microbiota), but not 
      in mice with intact microbiota. Germ-free mice given aspirin developed fewer 
      colorectal tumors than conventionalized germ-free mice given aspirin. Plasma 
      levels of aspirin were higher in mice given antibiotics than in mice with intact 
      gut microbiota. Analyses of luminal contents revealed that aerobic gut microbes, 
      including Lysinibacillus sphaericus, degrade aspirin. Germ-free mice fed L 
      sphaericus had lower plasma levels of aspirin than germ-free mice that were not 
      fed this bacterium. There was an inverse correlation between aspirin dose and 
      colorectal tumor development in conventional mice, but this correlation was lost 
      with increased abundance of L sphaericus. Fecal samples from mice fed aspirin 
      were enriched in Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus genera, which are considered 
      beneficial, and had reductions in Alistipes finegoldii and Bacteroides fragili, 
      which are considered pathogenic. CONCLUSIONS: Aspirin reduces development of 
      colorectal tumors in APC(min/+) mice and mice given azoxymethane and dextran 
      sulfate sodium, depending on the presence of intestinal microbes. L sphaericus in 
      the gut degrades aspirin and reduced its chemopreventive effects in mice. Fecal 
      samples from mice fed aspirin were enriched in beneficial bacteria, with 
      reductions in pathogenic bacteria.

AB  - The importance of gut microbiota in human health and pathophysiology is 
      undisputable. Despite the abundance of metagenomics data, the functional dynamics 
      of gut microbiota in human health and disease remain elusive. Urolithin A (UroA), 
      a major microbial metabolite derived from polyphenolics of berries and 
      pomegranate fruits displays anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and anti-ageing 
      activities. Here, we show that UroA and its potent synthetic analogue (UAS03) 
      significantly enhance gut barrier function and inhibit unwarranted inflammation. 
      We demonstrate that UroA and UAS03 exert their barrier functions through 
      activation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)- nuclear factor erythroid 2-related 
      factor 2 (Nrf2)-dependent pathways to upregulate epithelial tight junction 
      proteins. Importantly, treatment with these compounds attenuated colitis in 
      pre-clinical models by remedying barrier dysfunction in addition to 
      anti-inflammatory activities. Cumulatively, the results highlight how microbial 
      metabolites provide two-pronged beneficial activities at gut epithelium by 
      enhancing barrier functions and reducing inflammation to protect from colonic 
      diseases.

      colorectal adenoma and cancer.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: There is a need for early detection of colorectal cancer (CRC) at 
      precancerous-stage adenoma. Here, we identified novel faecal bacterial markers 
      for diagnosing adenoma. DESIGN: This study included 1012 subjects (274 CRC, 353 
      adenoma and 385 controls) from two independent Asian groups. Candidate markers 
      were identified by metagenomics and validated by targeted quantitative PCR. 
      RESULTS: Metagenomic analysis identified 'm3' from a Lachnoclostridium sp., 
      Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn) and Clostridium hathewayi (Ch) to be significantly 
      enriched in adenoma. Faecal m3 and Fn were significantly increased from normal to 
      adenoma to CRC (p<0.0001, linear trend by one-way ANOVA) in group I (n=698), 
      which was further confirmed in group II (n=313; p<0.0001). Faecal m3 may perform 
      better than Fn in distinguishing adenoma from controls (areas under the receiver 
      operating characteristic curve (AUROCs) m3=0.675 vs Fn=0.620, p=0.09), while Fn 
      performed better in diagnosing CRC (AUROCs Fn=0.862 vs m3=0.741, p<0.0001). At 
      78.5% specificity, m3 and Fn showed sensitivities of 48.3% and 33.8% for adenoma, 
      and 62.1% and 77.8% for CRC, respectively. In a subgroup tested with faecal 
      immunochemical test (FIT; n=642), m3 performed better than FIT in detecting 
      adenoma (sensitivities for non-advanced and advanced adenomas of 44.2% and 50.8% 
      by m3 (specificity=79.6%) vs 0% and 16.1% by FIT (specificity=98.5%)). Combining 
      with FIT improved sensitivity of m3 for advanced adenoma to 56.8%. The 
      combination of m3 with Fn, Ch, Bacteroides clarus and FIT performed best for 
      diagnosing CRC (specificity=81.2% and sensitivity=93.8%). CONCLUSION: This study 
      identifies a novel bacterial marker m3 for the non-invasive diagnosis of 
      colorectal adenoma.

LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2015-309800 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the potential for diagnosing colorectal cancer (CRC) from 
      faecal metagenomes. DESIGN: We performed metagenome-wide association studies on 
      faecal samples from 74 patients with CRC and 54 controls from China, and 
      validated the results in 16 patients and 24 controls from Denmark. We further 
      validated the biomarkers in two published cohorts from France and Austria. 
      Finally, we employed targeted quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays to evaluate 
      diagnostic potential of selected biomarkers in an independent Chinese cohort of 
      47 patients and 109 controls. RESULTS: Besides confirming known associations of 
      Fusobacterium nucleatum and Peptostreptococcus stomatis with CRC, we found 
      significant associations with several species, including Parvimonas micra and 
      Solobacterium moorei. We identified 20 microbial gene markers that differentiated 
      CRC and control microbiomes, and validated 4 markers in the Danish cohort. In the 
      French and Austrian cohorts, these four genes distinguished CRC metagenomes from 
      controls with areas under the receiver-operating curve (AUC) of 0.72 and 0.77, 
      respectively. qPCR measurements of two of these genes accurately classified 
      patients with CRC in the independent Chinese cohort with AUC=0.84 and OR of 23. 
      These genes were enriched in early-stage (I-II) patient microbiomes, highlighting 
      the potential for using faecal metagenomic biomarkers for early diagnosis of CRC. 
      CONCLUSIONS: We present the first metagenomic profiling study of CRC faecal 
      microbiomes to discover and validate microbial biomarkers in ethnically different 
      cohorts, and to independently validate selected biomarkers using an affordable 
      clinically relevant technology. Our study thus takes a step further towards 
      affordable non-invasive early diagnostic biomarkers for CRC from faecal samples.

TI  - Gastro-intestinal and oral microbiome signatures associated with healthy aging.
PG  - 907-921
LID - 10.1007/s11357-019-00098-8 [doi]
AB  - The human oral and gut microbiomes influence health via competition for a 
      distinct niche in the body with pathogens, via metabolic capabilities that 
      increase host digestive capacity and generate compounds engaged in signaling 
      pathways and modulation of immune system functions. Old age alters our metabolic 
      and regenerative capacity. Following recruitment of 65 human subjects in the age 
      range of 70 to 82, we discerned healthy aging (HA) and non-healthy aging (NHA) 
      cohorts discordant in the occurrence of one or more major diseases: (1) cancer, 
      (2) acute or chronic cardiovascular diseases, (3) acute or chronic pulmonary 
      diseases, (4) diabetes, and (5) stroke or neurodegenerative disorders. We 
      analyzed these cohorts' oral microbiomes (saliva) and gut microbiomes (stool) to 
      assess diversity and identify microbial biomarkers for HA. In contrast to the gut 
      microbiome where no change was observed, we found that the saliva microbiome had 
      higher α-diversity in the HA compared with the NHA group. We observed the genus 
      Akkermansia to be significantly more abundant in the gut microbiota of the HA 
      group. Akkermansia muciniphila is a colonic mucin-degrading bacterium believed to 
      have beneficial effects on gastrointestinal health, particularly in the context 
      of diabetes and obesity. Erysipelotrichaceae UCG-003 was a taxon increased in 
      abundance in the HA cohort. Streptococcus was the only genus observed to be 
      significantly decreased in abundance in both the gut and oral microbiomes of the 
      HA cohort compared with the NHA cohort. Our data support the notion that these 
      microbes are potential probiotics to decrease the risks of non-healthy aging.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence suggests that gut microbiota play a role in the 
      pathogenesis of breast cancer. The composition and functional capacity of gut 
      microbiota associated with breast cancer have not been studied systematically. 
      METHODS: We performed a comprehensive shotgun metagenomic analysis of 18 
      premenopausal breast cancer patients, 25 premenopausal healthy controls, 44 
      postmenopausal breast cancer patients, and 46 postmenopausal healthy controls. 
      RESULTS: Microbial diversity was higher in breast cancer patients than in 
      controls. Relative species abundance in gut microbiota did not differ 
      significantly between premenopausal breast cancer patients and premenopausal 
      controls. In contrast, relative abundance of 45 species differed significantly 
      between postmenopausal patients and postmenopausal controls: 38 species were 
      enriched in postmenopausal patients, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella 
      sp_1_1_55, Prevotella amnii, Enterococcus gallinarum, Actinomyces sp. HPA0247, 
      Shewanella putrefaciens, and Erwinia amylovora, and 7 species were less abundant 
      in postmenopausal patients, including Eubacterium eligens and Lactobacillus 
      vaginalis. Acinetobacter radioresistens and Enterococcus gallinarum were 
      positively but weakly associated with expression of high-sensitivity C-reactive 
      protein; Shewanella putrefaciens and Erwinia amylovora were positively but weakly 
      associated with estradiol levels. Actinomyces sp. HPA0247 negatively but weakly 
      correlated with CD3(+)CD8(+) T cell numbers. Further characterization of 
      metagenome functional capacity indicated that the gut metagenomes of 
      postmenopausal breast cancer patients were enriched in genes encoding 
      lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis, iron complex transport system, PTS system, 
      secretion system, and beta-oxidation. CONCLUSION: The composition and functions 
      of the gut microbial community differ between postmenopausal breast cancer 
      patients and healthy controls. The gut microbiota may regulate or respond to host 
      immunity and metabolic balance. Thus, while cause and effect cannot be 
      determined, there is a reproducible change in the microbiota of treatment-naive 
      patients relative to matched controls.

TI  - Gut Microbiota-Mediated Inflammation and Gut Permeability in Patients with 
      Obesity and Colorectal Cancer.
LID - 10.3390/ijms21186782 [doi]
LID - 6782
AB  - Obesity is considered an important factor that increases the risk of colorectal 
      cancer (CRC). So far, the association of gut microbiota with both obesity and 
      cancer has been described independently. Nevertheless, a specific obesity-related 
      microbial profile linked to CRC development has not been identified. The aim of 
      this study was to determine the gut microbiota composition in fecal samples from 
      CRC patients with (OB-CRC) and without obesity (L-CRC) compared to the microbiota 
      profile present in non-obese healthy controls (L-HC), in order to unravel the 
      possible relationship between gut microbiota and microbial-derived metabolite 
      trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), the inflammatory status, and the intestinal 
      permeability in the context of obesity-associated CRC. The presence of obesity 
      does not induce significant changes in the diversity and richness of intestinal 
      bacteria of CRC patients. Nevertheless, OB-CRC patients display a specific gut 
      microbiota profile characterized by a reduction in butyrate-producing bacteria 
      and an overabundance of opportunistic pathogens, which in turn could be 
      responsible, at least in part, for the higher levels of proinflammatory cytokine 
      IL-1β, the deleterious bacterial metabolite TMAO, and gut permeability found in 
      these patients. These results suggest a possible role of obesity-related gut 
      microbiota in the development of CRC, which could give new clues for the design 
      of new diagnostic tools for CRC prevention.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about the role of the genitourinary and 
      gastrointestinal microbiota in the pathogenesis of male infertility. OBJECTIVE: 
      To compare the taxonomic and functional profiles of the gut, semen, and urine 
      microbiomes of infertile and fertile men. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We 
      prospectively enrolled 25 men with primary idiopathic infertility and 12 healthy 
      men with proven paternity, and we collected rectal swabs, semen samples, 
      midstream urine specimens, and experimental controls. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND 
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: We performed comprehensive semen analysis, 16S rRNA 
      sequencing for quantitative high-resolution taxonomy, and shotgun metagenomics 
      with a median of 140 million reads per sample for functional metabolic pathway 
      profiling. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: We identified a diverse semen microbiome with 
      modest similarity to the urinary microbiome. Infertile men harbored increased 
      seminal α-diversity and distinct β-diversity, increased seminal Aerococcus, and 
      decreased rectal Anaerococcus. Prevotella abundance was inversely associated with 
      sperm concentration, and Pseudomonas was directly associated with total motile 
      sperm count. Vasectomy appeared to alter the seminal microbiome, suggesting a 
      testicular or epididymal contribution. Anaerobes were highly over-represented in 
      the semen of infertile men with a varicocele, but oxidative stress and 
      leukocytospermia were associated with only subtle differences. Metagenomics data 
      identified significant alterations in the S-adenosyl-L-methionine cycle, which 
      may play a multifaceted role in the pathogenesis of infertility via DNA 
      methylation, oxidative stress, and/or polyamine synthesis. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      pilot study represents the first comprehensive investigation into the microbiome 
      in male infertility. These findings provide the foundation for future 
      investigations to explore causality and identify novel microbiome-based 
      diagnostics and therapeutics for men with this complex and emotionally 
      devastating disease. PATIENT SUMMARY: We explored the resident populations of 
      bacteria living in the gut, semen, and urine of infertile and fertile men. We 
      found several important bacterial and metabolic pathway differences with the 
      potential to aid in diagnosing and treating male infertility in the future.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Studies have reported abnormal gut microbiota or circulating 
      metabolome associated with colorectal cancer (CRC), but it remains a challenge to 
      capture the CRC-relevant features consistent across geographic regions. This is 
      particularly the problem for metabolic traits of CRC because the analyses 
      generally use different platforms and laboratory methods, which poses a barrier 
      to cross-dataset examination. In light of this, we sought to elucidate the 
      microbial and metabolic signatures of CRC with broad population relevance. 
      METHODS: In this integrated metagenomic (healthy controls [HC], n = 91; 
      colorectal adenoma [CRA], n = 63; CRC, n = 71) and metabolomic (HC, n = 34; CRA, 
      n = 31; CRC, n = 35) analysis, CRC-associated features and microbe-metabolite 
      correlations were first identified from a Shanghai cohort. A gut microbial panel 
      was trained in the in-house cohort and cross-validated in 7 published metagenomic 
      datasets of CRC. The in-house metabolic connections to the cross-cohort microbial 
      signatures were used as evidence to infer serum metabolites with potentially 
      external relevance. In addition, a combined microbe-metabolite panel was produced 
      for diagnosing CRC or adenoma. RESULTS: CRC-associated alterations were 
      identified in the gut microbiome and serum metabolome. A composite 
      microbe-metabolite diagnostic panel was developed and yielded an area under the 
      curve of 0.912 for adenoma and 0.994 for CRC. We showed that many CRC-associated 
      metabolites were linked to cross-cohort gut microbiome signatures of the disease, 
      including CRC-enriched leucylalanine, serotonin, and imidazole propionate; and 
      CRC-depleted perfluorooctane sulfonate, 2-linoleoylglycerol (18:2), and 
      sphingadienine. CONCLUSIONS: We generated cross-cohort metagenomic signatures of 
      CRC, some of which linked to in-house CRC-associated serum metabolites. The 
      microbial and metabolic shifts may have wide population relevance.

AB  - A mysterious feature of Crohn's disease (CD) is the extra-intestinal 
      manifestation of "creeping fat" (CrF), defined as expansion of mesenteric adipose 
      tissue around the inflamed and fibrotic intestine. In the current study, we 
      explore whether microbial translocation in CD serves as a central cue for CrF 
      development. We discovered a subset of mucosal-associated gut bacteria that 
      consistently translocated and remained viable in CrF in CD ileal surgical 
      resections, and identified Clostridium innocuum as a signature of this consortium 
      with strain variation between mucosal and adipose isolates, suggesting preference 
      for lipid-rich environments. Single-cell RNA sequencing characterized CrF as both 
      pro-fibrotic and pro-adipogenic with a rich milieu of activated immune cells 
      responding to microbial stimuli, which we confirm in gnotobiotic mice colonized 
      with C. innocuum. Ex vivo validation of expression patterns suggests C. innocuum 
      stimulates tissue remodeling via M2 macrophages, leading to an adipose tissue 
      barrier that serves to prevent systemic dissemination of bacteria.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Gut microbiota contributes to colorectal cancer (CRC) pathogenesis 
      through microbes and their metabolites. The importance of microbiota-associated 
      metabolites in colorectal carcinogenesis highlights the need to investigate the 
      gut metabolome along the adenoma-carcinoma sequence to determine their 
      mechanistic implications in the pathogenesis of CRC. To date, how and which 
      microbes and metabolites interactively promote early events of CRC development 
      are still largely unclear. We aim to determine gut microbiota-associated 
      metabolites and their linkage to colorectal carcinogenesis. RESULTS: We performed 
      metabolomics and metagenomics profiling on fecal samples from 386 subjects 
      including 118 CRC patients, 140 colorectal adenomas (CRA) patients and 128 
      healthy subjects as normal controls (NC). We identified differences in the gut 
      metabolite profiles among NC, CRA and CRC groups by partial least 
      squares-discriminant and principal component analyses. Among the altered 
      metabolites, norvaline and myristic acid showed increasing trends from NC, 
      through CRA, to CRC. CRC-associated metabolites were enriched in branched-chain 
      amino acids, aromatic amino acids and aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis pathways. 
      Moreover, metabolites marker signature (twenty metabolites) classified CRC from 
      NC subjects with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.80, and CRC from CRA with an 
      AUC of 0.79. Integrative analyses of metabolomics and metagenomics profiles 
      demonstrated that the relationships among CRC-associated metabolites and bacteria 
      were altered across CRC stages; certain associations exhibited increasing or 
      decreasing strengths while some were reversed from negative to positive or vice 
      versa. Combinations of gut bacteria with the metabolite markers improved their 
      diagnostic performances; CRC vs NC, AUC: 0.94; CRC vs CRA, AUC 0.92; and CRA vs 
      NC, AUC: 0.86, indicating a potential for early diagnosis of colorectal 
      neoplasia. CONCLUSIONS: This study underscores potential early-driver metabolites 
      in stages of colorectal tumorigenesis. The Integrated metabolite and microbiome 
      analysis demonstrates that gut metabolites and their association with gut 
      microbiota are perturbed along colorectal carcinogenesis. Fecal metabolites can 
      be utilized, in addition to bacteria, for non-invasive diagnosis of colorectal 
      neoplasia. Video Abstract.

TI  - Fusobacterium Nucleatum Promotes the Development of Colorectal Cancer by 
      Activating a Cytochrome P450/Epoxyoctadecenoic Acid Axis via TLR4/Keap1/NRF2 
      Signaling.

AB  - Emerging research has revealed regulation of colorectal cancer metabolism by 
      bacteria. Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn) plays a crucial role in the development of 
      colorectal cancer, however, whether Fn infection modifies metabolism in patients 
      with colorectal cancer remains unknown. Here, LC-MS/MS-based lipidomics 
      identified the upregulation of cytochrome P450 monooxygenases, primarily CYP2J2, 
      and their mediated product 12,13-EpOME in patients with colorectal cancer tumors 
      and mouse models, which increased the invasive and migratory ability of 
      colorectal cancer cells in vivo and in vitro by regulating the 
      epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Metagenomic sequencing indicated a 
      positive correlation between increased levels of fecal Fn and serum 12,13-EpOME 
      in patients with colorectal cancer. High levels of CYP2J2 in tumor tissues also 
      correlated with high Fn levels and worse overall survival in patients with stage 
      III/IV colorectal cancer. Moreover, Fn was found to activate TLR4/AKT signaling, 
      downregulating Keap1 and increasing NRF2 to promote transcription of CYP2J2. 
      Collectively, these data identify that Fn promotes EMT and metastasis in 
      colorectal cancer by activating a TLR4/Keap1/NRF2 axis to increase CYP2J2 and 
      12,13-EpOME, which could serve as clinical biomarkers and therapeutic targets for 
      Fn-infected patients with colorectal cancer. SIGNIFICANCE: This study uncovers a 
      mechanism by which Fusobacterium nucleatum regulates colorectal cancer metabolism 
      to drive metastasis, suggesting the potential biomarker and therapeutic utility 
      of the CYP2J2/12,13-EpOME axis in Fn-infected patients.

AB  - Several bacterial species have been implicated in the development of colorectal 
      carcinoma (CRC), but CRC-associated changes of fecal microbiota and their 
      potential for cancer screening remain to be explored. Here, we used metagenomic 
      sequencing of fecal samples to identify taxonomic markers that distinguished CRC 
      patients from tumor-free controls in a study population of 156 participants. 
      Accuracy of metagenomic CRC detection was similar to the standard fecal occult 
      blood test (FOBT) and when both approaches were combined, sensitivity improved > 
      45% relative to the FOBT, while maintaining its specificity. Accuracy of 
      metagenomic CRC detection did not differ significantly between early- and 
      late-stage cancer and could be validated in independent patient and control 
      populations (N = 335) from different countries. CRC-associated changes in the 
      fecal microbiome at least partially reflected microbial community composition at 
      the tumor itself, indicating that observed gene pool differences may reveal 
      tumor-related host-microbe interactions. Indeed, we deduced a metabolic shift 
      from fiber degradation in controls to utilization of host carbohydrates and amino 
      acids in CRC patients, accompanied by an increase of lipopolysaccharide 
      metabolism.

AB  - The human intestinal microbiome plays a major role in human health and diseases, 
      including colorectal cancer. Colorectal carcinogenesis represents a heterogeneous 
      process with a differing set of somatic molecular alterations, influenced by 
      diet, environmental and microbial exposures, and host immunity. Fusobacterium 
      species are part of the human oral and intestinal microbiota. Metagenomic 
      analyses have shown an enrichment of Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum) in 
      colorectal carcinoma tissue. Using 511 colorectal carcinomas from Japanese 
      patients, we assessed the presence of F. nucleatum. Our results showed that the 
      frequency of F. nucleatum positivity in the Japanese colorectal cancer was 8.6% 
      (44/511), which was lower than that in United States cohort studies (13%). 
      Similar to the United States studies, F. nucleatum positivity in Japanese 
      colorectal cancers was significantly associated with microsatellite instability 
      (MSI)-high status. Regarding the immune response in colorectal cancer, high 
      levels of infiltrating T-cell subsets (i.e., CD3+, CD8+, CD45RO+, and FOXP3+ 
      cells) have been associated with better patient prognosis. There is also evidence 
      to indicate that molecular features of colorectal cancer, especially MSI, 
      influence T-cell-mediated adaptive immunity. Concerning the association between 
      the gut microbiome and immunity, F. nucleatum has been shown to expand 
      myeloid-derived immune cells, which inhibit T-cell proliferation and induce 
      T-cell apoptosis in colorectal cancer. This finding indicates that F. nucleatum 
      possesses immunosuppressive activities by inhibiting human T-cell responses. 
      Certain microRNAs are induced during the macrophage inflammatory response and 
      have the ability to regulate host-cell responses to pathogens. MicroRNA-21 
      increases the levels of IL-10 and prostaglandin E2, which suppress antitumor 
      T-cell-mediated adaptive immunity through the inhibition of the 
      antigen-presenting capacities of dendritic cells and T-cell proliferation in 
      colorectal cancer cells. Thus, emerging evidence may provide insights for 
      strategies to target microbiota, immune cells and tumor molecular alterations for 
      colorectal cancer prevention and treatment. Further investigation is needed to 
      clarify the association of Fusobacterium with T-cells and microRNA expressions in 
      colorectal cancer.

TI  - Links of gut microbiota composition with alcohol dependence syndrome and 
      alcoholic liver disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Alcohol abuse has deleterious effects on human health by disrupting 
      the functions of many organs and systems. Gut microbiota has been implicated in 
      the pathogenesis of alcohol-related liver diseases, with its composition 
      manifesting expressed dysbiosis in patients suffering from alcoholic dependence. 
      Due to its inherent plasticity, gut microbiota is an important target for 
      prevention and treatment of these diseases. Identification of the impact of 
      alcohol abuse with associated psychiatric symptoms on the gut community structure 
      is confounded by the liver dysfunction. In order to differentiate the effects of 
      these two factors, we conducted a comparative "shotgun" metagenomic survey of 99 
      patients with the alcohol dependence syndrome represented by two cohorts-with and 
      without liver cirrhosis. The taxonomic and functional composition of the gut 
      microbiota was subjected to a multifactor analysis including comparison with the 
      external control group. RESULTS: Alcoholic dependence and liver cirrhosis were 
      associated with profound shifts in gut community structures and metabolic 
      potential across the patients. The specific effects on species-level community 
      composition were remarkably different between cohorts with and without liver 
      cirrhosis. In both cases, the commensal microbiota was found to be depleted. 
      Alcoholic dependence was inversely associated with the levels of 
      butyrate-producing species from the Clostridiales order, while the cirrhosis-with 
      multiple members of the Bacteroidales order. The opportunist pathogens linked to 
      alcoholic dependence included pro-inflammatory Enterobacteriaceae, while the 
      hallmarks of cirrhosis included an increase of oral microbes in the gut and more 
      frequent occurrence of abnormal community structures. Interestingly, each of the 
      two factors was associated with the expressed enrichment in many Bifidobacterium 
      and Lactobacillus-but the exact set of the species was different between 
      alcoholic dependence and liver cirrhosis. At the level of functional potential, 
      the patients showed different patterns of increase in functions related to 
      alcohol metabolism and virulence factors, as well as pathways related to 
      inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple shifts in the community structure and 
      metabolic potential suggest strong negative influence of alcohol dependence and 
      associated liver dysfunction on gut microbiota. The identified differences in 
      patterns of impact between these two factors are important for planning of 
      personalized treatment and prevention of these pathologies via microbiota 
      modulation. Particularly, the expansion of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus 
      suggests that probiotic interventions for patients with alcohol-related disorders 
      using representatives of the same taxa should be considered with caution. 
      Taxonomic and functional analysis shows an increased propensity of the gut 
      microbiota to synthesis of the toxic acetaldehyde, suggesting higher risk of 
      colorectal cancer and other pathologies in alcoholics.

TI  - Connecting dysbiosis, bile-acid dysmetabolism and gut inflammation in 
      inflammatory bowel diseases.
PG  - 531-9

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Gut microbiota metabolises bile acids (BA). As dysbiosis has been 
      reported in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), we aim to investigate the impact 
      of IBD-associated dysbiosis on BA metabolism and its influence on the epithelial 
      cell inflammation response. DESIGN: Faecal and serum BA rates, expressed as a 
      proportion of total BA, were assessed by high-performance liquid chromatography 
      tandem mass spectrometry in colonic IBD patients (42) and healthy subjects (29). 
      The faecal microbiota composition was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR. 
      Using BA profiles and microbiota composition, cluster formation between groups 
      was generated by ranking models. The faecal BA profiles in germ-free and 
      conventional mice were compared. Direct enzymatic activities of BA 
      biotransformation were measured in faeces. The impact of BA on the inflammatory 
      response was investigated in vitro using Caco-2 cells stimulated by IL-1β. 
      RESULTS: IBD-associated dysbiosis was characterised by a decrease in the ratio 
      between Faecalibacterium prausntizii and Escherichia coli. Faecal-conjugated BA 
      rates were significantly higher in active IBD, whereas, secondary BA rates were 
      significantly lower. Interestingly, active IBD patients exhibited higher levels 
      of faecal 3-OH-sulphated BA. The deconjugation, transformation and desulphation 
      activities of the microbiota were impaired in IBD patients. In vitro, secondary 
      BA exerted anti-inflammatory effects, but sulphation of secondary BAs abolished 
      their anti-inflammatory properties. CONCLUSIONS: Impaired microbiota enzymatic 
      activity observed in IBD-associated dysbiosis leads to modifications in the 
      luminal BA pool composition. Altered BA transformation in the gut lumen can erase 
      the anti-inflammatory effects of some BA species on gut epithelial cells and 
      could participate in the chronic inflammation loop of IBD.

AB  - Despite a long-suspected role in the development of human colorectal cancer 
      (CRC), the composition of gut microbiota in CRC patients has not been adequately 
      described. In this study, fecal bacterial diversity in CRC patients (n=46) and 
      healthy volunteers (n=56) were profiled by 454 pyrosequencing of the V3 region of 
      the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Both principal component analysis and UniFrac 
      analysis showed structural segregation between the two populations. Forty-eight 
      operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified by redundancy analysis as key 
      variables significantly associated with the structural difference. One OTU 
      closely related to Bacteroides fragilis was enriched in the gut microbiota of CRC 
      patients, whereas three OTUs related to Bacteroides vulgatus and Bacteroides 
      uniformis were enriched in that of healthy volunteers. A total of 11 OTUs 
      belonging to the genera Enterococcus, Escherichia/Shigella, Klebsiella, 
      Streptococcus and Peptostreptococcus were significantly more abundant in the gut 
      microbiota of CRC patients, and 5 OTUs belonging to the genus Roseburia and other 
      butyrate-producing bacteria of the family Lachnospiraceae were less abundant. 
      Real-time quantitative PCR further validated the significant reduction of 
      butyrate-producing bacteria in the gut microbiota of CRC patients by measuring 
      the copy numbers of butyryl-coenzyme A CoA transferase genes (Mann-Whitney test, 
      P<0.01). Reduction of butyrate producers and increase of opportunistic pathogens 
      may constitute a major structural imbalance of gut microbiota in CRC patients.

AB  - Despite recent progress in our understanding of the association between the gut 
      microbiome and colorectal cancer (CRC), multi-kingdom gut microbiome dysbiosis in 
      CRC across cohorts is unexplored. We investigated four-kingdom microbiota 
      alterations using CRC metagenomic datasets of 1,368 samples from 8 distinct 
      geographical cohorts. Integrated analysis identified 20 archaeal, 27 bacterial, 
      20 fungal and 21 viral species for each single-kingdom diagnostic model. However, 
      our data revealed superior diagnostic accuracy for models constructed with 
      multi-kingdom markers, in particular the addition of fungal species. 
      Specifically, 16 multi-kingdom markers including 11 bacterial, 4 fungal and 1 
      archaeal feature, achieved good performance in diagnosing patients with CRC (area 
      under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) = 0.83) and maintained 
      accuracy across 3 independent cohorts. Coabundance analysis of the ecological 
      network revealed associations between bacterial and fungal species, such as 
      Talaromyces islandicus and Clostridium saccharobutylicum. Using metagenome 
      shotgun sequencing data, the predictive power of the microbial functional 
      potential was explored and elevated D-amino acid metabolism and butanoate 
      metabolism were observed in CRC. Interestingly, the diagnostic model based on 
      functional EggNOG genes achieved high accuracy (AUROC = 0.86). Collectively, our 
      findings uncovered CRC-associated microbiota common across cohorts and 
      demonstrate the applicability of multi-kingdom and functional markers as CRC 
      diagnostic tools and, potentially, as therapeutic targets for the treatment of 
      CRC.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Altered gut microbiota is implicated in development of 
      colorectal cancer (CRC). Some intestinal bacteria have been reported to 
      potentiate intestinal carcinogenesis by producing genotoxins, altering the immune 
      response and intestinal microenvironment, and activating oncogenic signaling 
      pathways. We investigated whether stool from patients with CRC could directly 
      induce colorectal carcinogenesis in mice. METHODS: We obtained stored stool 
      samples from participants in a metagenome study performed in Hong Kong. 
      Conventional (male C57BL/6) mice were given azoxymethane to induce colon 
      neoplasia after receiving a course of antibiotics in drinking water. Mice were 
      gavaged twice weekly with stool from 5 patients with CRC or 5 healthy individuals 
      (controls) for 5 weeks. Germ-free C57BL/6 mice were gavaged once with stool from 
      5 patients with CRC or 5 controls. We collected intestinal tissues from mice and 
      performed histology, immunohistochemistry, expression microarray, quantitative 
      polymerase chain reaction, immunoblot, and flow cytometry analyses. We performed 
      16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing analysis of feces from mice. RESULTS: 
      Significantly higher proportions of conventional mice fed with stool from 
      individuals with CRC than control stool developed high-grade dysplasia (P < .05) 
      and macroscopic polyps (P < .01). We observed a higher proportion of 
      proliferating (Ki-67-positive) cells in colons of germ-free mice fed with stool 
      from patients with CRC vs those fed with stool from controls (P < .05). Feces 
      from germ-free and conventional mice fed with stool from patients with CRC vs 
      controls contained different microbial compositions, with lower richness in mice 
      fed with stool from patients with CRC. Intestines collected from conventional and 
      germ-free mice fed with stool from patients with CRC had increased expression of 
      cytokines that modulate inflammation, including C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 1, 
      C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 2, interleukin 17A (IL17A), IL22, and IL23A. 
      Intestines from conventional and germ-free mice fed with stool from patients with 
      CRC contained higher proportions of T-helper 1 (Th1) cells (2.25% vs 0.44%) 
      and Th17 cells (2.08% vs 0.31%) (P < .05 for each) than mice fed with stool from 
      controls. Real-time polymerase chain reaction arrays revealed up-regulation of 
      genes involved in cell proliferation, stemness, apoptosis, angiogenesis, 
      invasiveness, and metastasis in mice fed with stool from patients with CRC. 
      CONCLUSIONS: We fed stool samples from patients with CRC and heathy individuals 
      to germ-free mice and conventional mice with azoxymethane. We found stool from 
      patients with CRC to increase the numbers of polyps, levels of intestinal 
      dysplasia and proliferation, markers of inflammation, and proportions of Th1 and 
      Th17 cells in colon, compared with stool from individuals without CRC. This study 
      provides evidence that the fecal microbiota from patients with CRC can promote 
      tumorigenesis in germ-free mice and mice given a carcinogen.

AB  - Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most prevalent cancers affecting humans, 
      with a complex genetic and environmental aetiology. Unlike cancers with known 
      environmental, heritable, or sex-linked causes, sporadic CRC is hard to foresee 
      and has no molecular biomarkers of risk in clinical use. One in twenty CRC cases 
      presents with an established heritable component. The remaining cases are 
      sporadic and associated with partially obscure genetic, epigenetic, regenerative, 
      microbiological, dietary, and lifestyle factors. To tackle this complexity, we 
      should improve the practice of colonoscopy, which is recommended uniformly beyond 
      a certain age, to include an assessment of biomarkers indicative of individual 
      CRC risk. Ideally, such biomarkers will be causal to the disease and potentially 
      modifiable upon dietary or therapeutic interventions. Multi-omics analysis, 
      including transcriptional, epigenetic as well as metagenomic, and metabolomic 
      profiles, are urgently required to provide data for risk analyses. The aim of 
      this article is to provide a perspective on the multifactorial derailment of 
      homeostasis leading to the initiation of CRC, which may be explored via 
      multi-omics and Gut-on-Chip analysis to identify much-needed predictive 
      biomarkers.

TI  - Mendelian Randomization of Circulating Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids and Colorectal 
      Cancer Risk.
PG  - 860-870
LID - 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-19-0891 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Results from epidemiologic studies examining polyunsaturated fatty 
      acids (PUFA) and colorectal cancer risk are inconsistent. Mendelian randomization 
      may strengthen causal inference from observational studies. Given their shared 
      metabolic pathway, examining the combined effects of aspirin/NSAID use with PUFAs 
      could help elucidate an association between PUFAs and colorectal cancer risk. 
      METHODS: Information was leveraged from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) 
      regarding PUFA-associated SNPs to create weighted genetic scores (wGS) 
      representing genetically predicted circulating blood PUFAs for 11,016 
      non-Hispanic white colorectal cancer cases and 13,732 controls in the Genetics 
      and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium (GECCO). Associations per SD 
      increase in the wGS were estimated using unconditional logistic regression. 
      Interactions between PUFA wGSs and aspirin/NSAID use on colorectal cancer risk 
      were also examined. RESULTS: Modest colorectal cancer risk reductions were 
      observed per SD increase in circulating linoleic acid [OR(LA) = 0.96; 95% 
      confidence interval (CI) = 0.93-0.98; P = 5.2 × 10(-4)] and α-linolenic acid 
      (OR(ALA) = 0.95; 95% CI = 0.92-0.97; P = 5.4 × 10(-5)), whereas modest increased 
      risks were observed for arachidonic (OR(AA) = 1.06; 95% CI = 1.03-1.08; P = 3.3 × 
      10(-5)), eicosapentaenoic (OR(EPA) = 1.04; 95% CI = 1.01-1.07; P = 2.5 × 10(-3)), 
      and docosapentaenoic acids (OR(DPA) = 1.03; 95% CI = 1.01-1.06; P = 1.2 × 
      10(-2)). Each of these effects was stronger among aspirin/NSAID nonusers in the 
      stratified analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that higher circulating 
      shorter-chain PUFAs (i.e., LA and ALA) were associated with reduced colorectal 
      cancer risk, whereas longer-chain PUFAs (i.e., AA, EPA, and DPA) were associated 
      with an increased colorectal cancer risk. IMPACT: The interaction of PUFAs with 
      aspirin/NSAID use indicates a shared colorectal cancer inflammatory pathway. 
      Future research should continue to improve PUFA genetic instruments to elucidate 
      the independent effects of PUFAs on colorectal cancer.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Sulfur-metabolizing bacteria that reduce dietary sulfur to hydrogen 
      sulfide have been associated with colorectal cancer (CRC). However, there are 
      limited studies investigating the association between diet and 
      sulfur-metabolizing bacteria in the development of CRC. OBJECTIVE: To develop a 
      dietary score that correlates with gut sulfur-metabolizing bacteria and to 
      examine its association with CRC risk. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This 
      prospective cohort study included data from the Health Professionals Follow-up 
      Study (1986-2014), Nurses' Health Study (1984-2016), and Nurses' Health Study II 
      (1991-2017). Participants were US male health professionals and female registered 
      nurses who were free of inflammatory bowel disease and cancer at baseline, with a 
      subsample of participants who provided stool samples from 2012 to 2014. 
      Statistical analysis was conducted from September 1, 2020, to June 1, 2021. 
      EXPOSURE: A dietary pattern, assessed by a food-frequency questionnaire, that 
      most correlated with 43 sulfur-metabolizing bacteria identified through taxonomic 
      and functional profiling of gut metagenome data. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: 
      Incident CRC. RESULTS: Among 214 797 participants comprising 46 550 men (mean 
      [SD] age at baseline, 54.3 [9.7] years) and 168 247 women (mean [SD] age at 
      baseline, 43.0 [9.2] years), 3217 incident cases of CRC (1.5%) were documented 
      during 5 278 048 person-years of follow-up. The sulfur microbial diet, developed 
      in a subsample of 307 men (mean [SD] age, 70.5 [4.3] years) and 212 women (mean 
      [SD] age, 61.0 [3.8] years), was characterized by high intakes of low-calorie 
      beverages, french fries, red meats, and processed meats and low intakes of 
      fruits, yellow vegetables, whole grains, legumes, leafy vegetables, and 
      cruciferous vegetables. After adjustment for other risk factors, greater 
      adherence to the sulfur microbial diet was associated with an increased risk of 
      CRC, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.27 (95% CI, 1.12-1.44) comparing the highest 
      vs the lowest quintile of the diet score (linear trend of diet score quintiles; 
      P < .001 for trend). When assessed by anatomical subsites, greater adherence to 
      the sulfur microbial diet was positively associated with distal CRC (HR, 1.25; 
      95% CI, 1.05-1.50; P = .02 for trend) but not proximal colon cancer (HR, 1.13; 
      95% CI, 0.93-1.39; P = .19 for trend). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Adherence to 
      the sulfur microbial diet was associated with an increased risk of CRC, 
      suggesting a potential mediating role of sulfur-metabolizing bacteria in the 
      associaton between diet and CRC. Further research is needed to confirm these 
      findings and to determine the underlying mechanisms.

TI  - Metagenome Analysis of Intestinal Bacteria in Healthy People, Patients With 
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Colorectal Cancer.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Several reports suggesting that the intestinal microbiome plays a key 
      role in the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or colorectal cancer 
      (CRC), but the changes of intestinal bacteria in healthy people, patients with 
      IBD and CRC are not fully explained. The study aimed to investigate changes of 
      intestinal bacteria in healthy subjects, patients with IBD, and patients with 
      CRC. MATERIALS: We collected data from the European Nucleotide Archive on healthy 
      people and patients with colorectal cancer with the study accession number 
      PRJEB6070, PRJEB7774, PRJEB27928, PRJEB12449, and PRJEB10878, collected IBD 
      patient data from the Integrated Human Microbiome Project from the Human 
      Microbiome Project Data Portal. We performed metagenome-wide association studies 
      on the fecal samples from 290 healthy subjects, 512 IBD patients, and 285 CRC 
      patients. We used the metagenomics dataset to study bacterial community 
      structure, relative abundance, functional prediction, differentially abundant 
      bacteria, and co-occurrence networks. RESULTS: The bacterial community structure 
      in both IBD and CRC was significantly different from healthy subjects. Our 
      results showed that IBD patients had low intestinal bacterial diversity and CRC 
      patients had high intestinal bacterial diversity compared to healthy subjects. At 
      the phylum level, the relative abundance of Firmicutes in IBD decreased 
      significantly, while the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes increased 
      significantly. At the genus level, the relative abundance of Bacteroides in IBD 
      was higher than in healthy people and CRC. Compared with healthy people and CRC, 
      the main difference of intestinal bacteria in IBD patients was Bacteroidetes, and 
      compared with healthy people and IBD, the main difference of intestinal bacteria 
      in CRC patients was in Fusobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, and Proteobacteria. The 
      main differences in the functional composition of intestinal bacteria in healthy 
      people, IBD and CRC patients were L-homoserine and L-methionine biosynthesis, 
      5-aminoimidazole ribonucleotide biosynthesis II, L-methionine biosynthesis I, and 
      superpathway of L-lysine, L-threonine, and L-methionine biosynthesis I. The 
      results of stratified showed that the abundance of Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and 
      Actinobacteria involved in metabolic pathways has significantly changed. Besides, 
      the association network of intestinal bacteria in healthy people, IBD, and CRC 
      patients has also changed. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, compared with healthy 
      people, the taxonomic and functional composition of intestinal bacteria in IBD 
      and CRC patients was significantly changed.

AB  - Bacteriophages are the most abundant members of the microbiota and have the 
      potential to shape gut bacterial communities. Changes to bacteriophage 
      composition are associated with disease, but how phages impact mammalian health 
      remains unclear. We noted an induction of host immunity when experimentally 
      treating bacterially driven cancer, leading us to test whether bacteriophages 
      alter immune responses. Treating germ-free mice with bacteriophages leads to 
      immune cell expansion in the gut. Lactobacillus, Escherichia, and Bacteroides 
      bacteriophages and phage DNA stimulated IFN-γ via the nucleotide-sensing receptor 
      TLR9. The resultant immune responses were both phage and bacteria specific. 
      Additionally, increasing bacteriophage levels exacerbated colitis via TLR9 and 
      IFN-γ. Similarly, ulcerative colitis (UC) patients responsive to fecal microbiota 
      transplantation (FMT) have reduced phages compared to non-responders, and mucosal 
      IFN-γ positively correlates with bacteriophage levels. Bacteriophages from active 
      UC patients induced more IFN-γ compared to healthy individuals. Collectively, 
      these results indicate that bacteriophages can alter mucosal immunity to impact 
      mammalian health.

TI  - The BE GONE trial study protocol: a randomized crossover dietary intervention of 
      dry beans targeting the gut microbiome of overweight and obese patients with a 
      history of colorectal polyps or cancer.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mouse and human studies support the promise of dry beans to improve 
      metabolic health and to lower cancer risk. In overweight/obese patients with a 
      history of colorectal polyps or cancer, the Beans to Enrich the Gut microbiome 
      vs. Obesity's Negative Effects (BE GONE) trial will test whether and how an 
      increase in the consumption of pre-cooked, canned dry beans within the context of 
      usual diet and lifestyle can enhance the gut landscape to improve metabolic 
      health and reduce cancer risk. METHODS/DESIGN: This randomized crossover trial is 
      designed to characterize changes in (1) host markers spanning lipid metabolism, 
      inflammation, and obesity-related cancer risk; (2) compositional and functional 
      profiles of the fecal microbiome; and (3) host and microbial metabolites. With 
      each subject serving as their own control, the trial will compare the 
      participant's usual diet with (intervention) and without (control) dry beans. 
      Canned, pre-cooked dry beans are provided to participants and the usual diet 
      continually assessed and monitored. Following a 4-week run-in and equilibration 
      period, each participant provides a total of 5 fasting blood and 6 stool samples 
      over a total period of 16 weeks. The intervention consists of a 2-week ramp-up of 
      dry bean intake to 1 cup/d, which is then continued for an additional 6 weeks. 
      Intra- and inter-individual outcomes are assessed across each crossover period 
      with consideration of the joint or modifying effects of the usual diet and 
      baseline microbiome. DISCUSSION: The BE GONE trial is evaluating a scalable 
      dietary prevention strategy targeting the gut microbiome of high-risk patients to 
      mitigate the metabolic and inflammatory effects of adiposity that influence 
      colorectal cancer risk, recurrence, and survival. The overarching scientific goal 
      is to further elucidate interactions between diet, the gut microbiome, and host 
      metabolism. Improved understanding of the diet-microbiota interplay and effective 
      means to target these relationships will be key to the future of clinical and 
      public health approaches to cancer and other major diet- and obesity-related 
      diseases. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This protocol is registered with the U.S. National 
      Institutes of Health trial registry, ClinicalTrials.gov, under the identifier 
      NCT02843425. First posted July 25, 2016; last verified January 25, 2019.

      Biomarkers for Colorectal Cancer.

AB  - Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer mortality 
      worldwide. The dysbiotic gut microbiota and its metabolite secretions play a 
      significant role in CRC development and progression. In this study, we identified 
      microbial and metabolic biomarkers applicable to CRC using a meta-analysis of 
      metagenomic datasets from diverse geographical regions. We used LEfSe, random 
      forest (RF), and co-occurrence network methods to identify microbial biomarkers. 
      Geographic dataset-specific markers were identified and evaluated using area 
      under the ROC curve (AUC) scores and random effect size. Co-occurrence networks 
      analysis showed a reduction in the overall microbial associations and the 
      presence of oral pathogenic microbial clusters in CRC networks. Analysis of 
      predicted metabolites from CRC datasets showed the enrichment of amino acids, 
      cadaverine, and creatine in CRC, which were positively correlated with 
      CRC-associated microbes (Peptostreptococcus stomatis, Gemella morbillorum, 
      Bacteroides fragilis, Parvimonas spp., Fusobacterium nucleatum, Solobacterium 
      moorei, and Clostridium symbiosum), and negatively correlated with 
      control-associated microbes. Conversely, butyrate, nicotinamide, choline, 
      tryptophan, and 2-hydroxybutanoic acid showed positive correlations with 
      control-associated microbes (P < 0.05). Overall, our study identified a set of 
      global CRC biomarkers that are reproducible across geographic regions. We also 
      reported significant differential metabolites and microbe-metabolite interactions 
      associated with CRC. This study provided significant insights for further 
      investigations leading to the development of noninvasive CRC diagnostic tools and 
      therapeutic interventions. IMPORTANCE Several studies showed associations between 
      gut dysbiosis and CRC. Yet, the results are not conclusive due to cohort-specific 
      associations that are influenced by genomic, dietary, and environmental stimuli 
      and associated reproducibility issues with various analysis approaches. Emerging 
      evidence suggests the role of microbial metabolites in modulating host 
      inflammation and DNA damage in CRC. However, the experimental validations have 
      been hindered by cost, resources, and cumbersome technical expertise required for 
      metabolomic investigations. In this study, we performed a meta-analysis of CRC 
      microbiota data from diverse geographical regions using multiple methods to 
      achieve reproducible results. We used a computational approach to predict the 
      metabolomic profiles using existing CRC metagenomic datasets. We identified a 
      reliable set of CRC-specific biomarkers from this analysis, including microbial 
      and metabolite markers. In addition, we revealed significant microbe-metabolite 
      associations through correlation analysis and microbial gene families associated 
      with dysregulated metabolic pathways in CRC, which are essential in understanding 
      the vastly sporadic nature of CRC development and progression.

TI  - Cancer as microenvironmental, systemic and environmental diseases: opportunity

AB  - Cancer is generally regarded as a localised disease, with the well-established 
      role of the tumour microenvironment. However, the realm of cancer goes beyond the 
      tumour microenvironment, and cancer should also be regarded as a systemic and 
      environmental disease. The exposome (ie, the totality of exposures), which 
      encompasses diets, supplements, smoking, alcohol, other lifestyle factors, 
      medications, etc, likely alters the microbiome (inclusive of bacteria, viruses, 
      archaea, fungi, parasites, etc) and immune system in various body sites and 
      influences tumour phenotypes. The systemic metabolic/inflammatory status, which 
      is likely influenced by exposures and intestinal physiological changes, may 
      affect tissue microenvironment of colorectum and any other organs. Germline 
      genomic factors can modify disease phenotypes via gene-by-environment 
      interactions. Although challenges exist, it is crucial to advance not only basic 
      experimental research that can analyse the effects of exposures, microorganisms 
      and microenvironmental components on tumour evolution but also interdisciplinary 
      human population research that can dissect the complex pathogenic roles of the 
      exposome, microbiome and immunome. Metagenomic, metatranscriptomic and 
      metabolomic analyses should be integrated into well-designed population research 
      combined with advanced methodologies of artificial intelligence and molecular 
      pathological epidemiology. Ideally, a prospective cohort study design that 
      enables biospecimen (such as stool) collection before disease detection should be 
      considered to address reverse causation and recall biases. Robust experimental 
      and observational research together can provide insights into dynamic 
      interactions between environmental exposures, microbiota, tumour and immunity 
      during carcinogenesis processes, thereby helping us develop precision prevention 
      and therapeutic strategies to ultimately reduce the cancer burden.

TI  - Candidate Gene Discovery in Hereditary Colorectal Cancer and Polyposis 
      Syndromes-Considerations for Future Studies.
LID - 10.3390/ijms21228757 [doi]
LID - 8757
AB  - To discover novel high-penetrant risk loci for hereditary colorectal cancer 
      (hCRC) and polyposis syndromes many whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing 
      (WES/WGS) studies have been performed. Remarkably, these studies resulted in only 
      a few novel high-penetrant risk genes. Given this observation, the possibility 
      and strategy to identify high-penetrant risk genes for hCRC and polyposis needs 
      reconsideration. Therefore, we reviewed the study design of WES/WGS-based hCRC 
      and polyposis gene discovery studies (n = 37) and provide recommendations to 
      optimize discovery and validation strategies. The group of genetically unresolved 
      patients is phenotypically heterogeneous, and likely composed of distinct 
      molecular subtypes. This knowledge advocates for the screening of a homogeneous, 
      stringently preselected discovery cohort and obtaining multi-level evidence for 
      variant pathogenicity. This evidence can be collected by characterizing the 
      molecular landscape of tumors from individuals with the same affected gene or by 
      functional validation in cell-based models. Together, the combined approach of a 
      phenotype-driven, tumor-based candidate gene search might elucidate the potential 
      contribution of novel genetic predispositions in genetically unresolved hCRC and 
      polyposis.

TI  - Gut microbiome associated with APC gene mutation in patients with intestinal 
      adenomatous polyps.
PG  - 135-146
LID - 10.7150/ijbs.37399 [doi]
AB  - Background: The 'adenoma-carcinoma sequence' is a well-recognized model of 
      colorectal cancer (CRC) development. However, the interaction between gut 
      microbiota and genetic variation in the initiation of CRC is not clear. Our study 
      attempts to demonstrate the relationship between gut microbiota and host genetics 
      in patients with intestinal adenomatous polyps. Method: The entire exon region of 
      the APC gene was sequenced in 35 patients with pathologically diagnosed 
      adenomatous polyps. Patients with highly pathogenic APC mutation were classified 
      as the case group, while the others were classified as the control group. The 
      patients'stool and serum samples were respectively collected for metagenomics and 
      metabolomics measurements. Results: In the analysis of gut microbiome, there were 
      three most important species, in which Fusobacterium_mortiferum was significantly 
      increased while Faecalibacterium_prausnitzii and 
      Bifidobacterium_pseudocatenulatum were significantly decreased in the case group. 
      The significantly low abundance of the Photosynthesis pathway in patients with 
      APC mutation was due to the low abundance of species Faecalibacterium_prausnitzii 
      and Bifidobacterium_pseudocatenulatum. Moreover, there were two clusters of KEGG 
      pathways correlated with two clusters of species characterized by 
      Faecalibacterium_prausnitzii and Fusobacterium_mortiferum. As to serum 
      metabolomics, the abundance of (R)-3-Hydroxybutyric acid and 
      2-Hydroxyphenethylamine were significantly higher in patients with APC mutation, 
      while the abundance of 1-Aminocyclopropanecarboxylic acid,7-Ketocholesterol, 
      DL-lactate, and L-Pyroglutamic acid were significantly higher in controlgroup. 
      After analyzing the metabolome and microbiome data by sparCCmethod, we found that 
      there was a significantly negative correlation between the abundance of 
      Faecalibacterium_prausnitzii and Fusobacterium_mortiferum, and a significantly 
      positive correlation between Faecalibacterium_prausnitzii abundance and the 
      steroid hormone Hydrocortisone (Cortisol) in serum. Conclusions: Host's APC 
      mutation was closely related to the changes of gut microbiota and serum 
      metabolites, and some species of gut microbiome like Faecalibacterium_prausnitzii 
      and Fusobacterium_mortiferum might have the potential to predict the development 
      of CRC from intestinal adenomatous polyps.

TI  - Whole-Genome Profiles of Malay Colorectal Cancer Patients with Intact MMR 
      Proteins.
LID - 10.3390/genes12091448 [doi]
LID - 1448
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to identify new genes associated with CRC in 
      patients with normal mismatch repair (MMR) protein expression. METHOD: 
      Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed in seven early-age-onset Malay CRC 
      patients. Potential germline genetic variants, including single-nucleotide 
      variations and insertions and deletions (indels), were prioritized using 
      functional and predictive algorithms. RESULTS: An average of 3.2 million 
      single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) and over 800 indels were identified. Three 
      potential candidate variants in three genes-IFNE, PTCH2 and SEMA3D-which were 
      predicted to affect protein function, were identified in three Malay CRC 
      patients. In addition, 19 candidate genes-ANKDD1B, CENPM, CLDN5, MAGEB16, 
      MAP3K14, MOB3C, MS4A12, MUC19, OR2L8, OR51Q1, OR51AR1, PDE4DIP, PKD1L3, PRIM2, 
      PRM3, SEC22B, TPTE, USP29 and ZNF117-harbouring nonsense variants were 
      prioritised. These genes are suggested to play a role in cancer predisposition 
      and to be associated with cancer risk. Pathway enrichment analysis indicated 
      significant enrichment in the olfactory signalling pathway. CONCLUSION: This 
      study provides a new spectrum of insights into the potential genes, variants and 
      pathways associated with CRC in Malay patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The effect of metformin on gut microbiota has been reported, but 
      whether metformin can suppress colorectal cancer (CRC) by affecting gut 
      microbiota composition and rescue F. nucleatum-induced tumourigenicity remains 
      unclear. METHODS: To identify microbiota associated with both CRC occurrence and 
      metformin treatment, first, we reanalyzed the gut microbiome of our previous data 
      on two human cohorts of normal and CRC individuals. Subsequently, we summarized 
      microbiota altered by metformin from published literatures. Several taxa, 
      including Fusobacterium, were associated with both CRC occurrence and metformin 
      treatment. We investigated the effect of metformin on APC(Min/+) mice given with 
      or without F. nucleatum. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed. FINDINGS: We 
      summarized 131 genera altered by metformin from 18 published literatures. Five 
      genera reported to be changed by metformin, including Bacteroides, Streptococcus, 
      Achromobacter, Alistipes and Fusobacterium, were associated with CRC in both of 
      our human cohorts. Metformin relieved the symptoms caused by F. nucleatum 
      administration in APC(Min/+) mice, and showed promise in suppressing intestinal 
      tumour formation and rescuing F. nucleatum-induced tumourigenicity. 
      Administration of F. nucleatum and/or metformin had effect on gut microbiome 
      structure, composition and functions of APC(Min/+) mice. INTERPRETATION: This 
      study pioneers in predicting critical CRC-associated taxa contributing to the 
      antitumour effect of metformin, and correlating gut microbiome with the 
      antitumour effect of metformin in experimental animals. We presented a basis for 
      future investigations into metformin's potential effect on suppressing F. 
      nucleatum-induced tumor formation in vivo. FUNDING: This work was supported by 
      grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31701250).

TI  - Coffee, colon function and colorectal cancer.
PG  - 916-22

AB  - For several years the physiological effects of coffee have been focused on its 
      caffeine content, disregarding the hundreds of bioactive coffee components, such 
      as polyphenols, melanoidins, carbohydrates, diterpenes, etc. These compounds may 
      exert their protection against colorectal cancer (CRC), the third most common 
      cancer worldwide. However, the amount and type of compounds ingested with the 
      beverage may be highly different depending on the variety of coffee used, the 
      roasting degree, the type of brewing method as well as the serving size. In this 
      frame, this paper reviews the mechanisms by which coffee may influence the risk 
      of CRC development focusing on espresso and filtered coffee, as well as on the 
      components that totally or partially reach the colon i.e. polyphenols and dietary 
      fiber, including melanoidins. In particular the effects of coffee on some colon 
      conditions whose deregulation may lead to cancer, namely microbiota composition 
      and lumen reducing environment, were considered. Taken together the discussed 
      studies indicated that, due to their in vivo metabolism and composition, both 
      coffee chlorogenic acids and dietary fiber, including melanoidins, may reduce CRC 
      risk, increasing colon motility and antioxidant status. Further studies should 
      finally assess whether the coffee benefits for colon are driven through a 
      prebiotic effect.

AB  - Colorectal cancer is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. 
      Understanding its genetic mechanisms is key to improving risk prediction, 
      prognostication and treatment. Results from genome-wide association studies have 
      engendered a growing list of colorectal cancer susceptibility genes whereas the 
      application of genome-wide mutational analysis has enabled the depiction of 
      mutational landscape of colorectal cancer at high resolution. The development of 
      novel technologies, such as metagenomic and single-cell sequencing, is expected 
      to have positive impact on future genetic studies. However, challenges remain to 
      address the changing epidemiology of colorectal cancer, issues on genetic 
      testing, and clinical utilization of genomic data.

TI  - Association of the microbiome with colorectal cancer development (Review).

AB  - Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common malignancy causing 
      cancer‑related mortality globally. It is the third most common type of cancer 
      detected worldwide. The recent concept of the human body supporting a diverse 
      community of microbes has revealed the important role these microbes play 
      synergistically in maintaining normal homeostasis. The balance between the 
      microbiomes and epithelial cells of the human body is essential for normal 
      physiology. Evidence from meta‑genome analysis indicates that an imbalance in the 
      microbiome is prominent in the guts of patients with CRC. Several studies have 
      suggested that the gut microbiota can secrete metabolites [short‑chain fatty 
      acids (SCFAs), vitamins, polyphenols and polyamines] that modulate the 
      susceptibility of the colon and rectum by altering inflammation and DNA damage. 
      The state of microbiome imbalance (dysbiosis) has been reported in patients with 
      CRC, with an increasing population of 'bad' microbes and a decrease in 'good' 
      microbes. The 'good' microbes, also known as commensal microbes, produce 
      butyrate; however, 'bad' microbes cause a pro‑inflammatory state. The complex 
      association between pathological microbial communities leading to cancer 
      progression is not yet fully understood. An altered microbial metabolite profile 
      plays a direct role in CRC metabolism. Furthermore, diet plays an essential role 
      in the risk of gastrointestinal cancer development. High‑fiber diets regulate the 
      gut microbiome and reduce the risk of CRC development, and may be fruitful in the 
      better management of therapeutics. In the present review, the current status of 
      the microbiome in CRC development is discussed.12.

TI  - Characterization of tumor-infiltrating immune cells in relation to microbiota in 
      colorectal cancers.
PG  - 23-32
LID - 10.1007/s00262-019-02433-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several articles have recently reported that certain colon microbiota 
      can improve the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. To develop new treatment 
      strategies, including immunotherapy for colorectal cancer (CRC), we evaluated the 
      correlations between subpopulations of tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIICs) 
      and intestinal microbiota in CRC. METHODS: Fresh surgically resected specimens, 
      formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded whole tissue samples, and stool samples were 
      collected. TIICs including Tregs, Th17 cells and tumor-associated macrophages 
      (TAMs) in the surgically resected specimens were analyzed using flow cytometry. 
      FOXp3, CD8, CD163, and phosphorylated-STAT1-positive TIICs in the whole tissue 
      samples were analyzed using IHC, and intestinal microbiota in the stool samples 
      was analyzed using 16S metagenome sequencing. TIICs subpopulations in the normal 
      mucosa and tumor samples were evaluated, and the correlations between the TIIC 
      subpopulations and intestinal microbiota were analyzed. RESULTS: 
      FOXp3(low)CD45RA(+) Tregs were significantly reduced (p = 0.02), 
      FOXp3(low)CD45RA(-) Tregs were significantly increased (p = 0.006), and M1 TAMs 
      were significantly reduced in the tumor samples (p = 0.03). Bacteroides (phylum 
      Bacteroidetes) and Faecalibacterium (phylum Firmicutes) were increased in the 
      patients with high numbers of Tregs and clearly high distribution of 
      FOXp3(high)CD45RA(-) Tregs, which are the effector Tregs. Faecalibacterium, 
      Ruminococcaceae, Eubacterium (phylum Firmicutes), and Bacteroides were increased 
      in patients with a high distribution of M1 TAMs. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the 
      present study indicate that immune responses to tumors are suppressed in the 
      tumor microenvironment of CRC depending on the increment of Tregs and the 
      reduction of M1 TAMs and that intestinal microbiota might be involved in 
      immunosuppression.

AB  - Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death in 
      the world. Besides genetic causes, colonic inflammation is one of the major risk 
      factors for CRC development, which is synergistically regulated by multiple 
      components, including innate and adaptive immune cells, cytokine signaling, and 
      microbiota. The complex interaction between CRC and the gut microbiome has 
      emerged as an important area of current CRC research. Metagenomic profiling has 
      identified a number of prominent CRC-associated bacteria that are enriched in CRC 
      patients, linking the microbiota composition to colitis and cancer development. 
      Some microbiota species have been reported to promote colitis and CRC development 
      in preclinical models, while a few others are identified as immune modulators to 
      induce potent protective immunity against colitis and CRC. Mechanistically, 
      microbiota regulates the activation of different immune cell populations, 
      inflammation, and CRC via crosstalk between innate and adaptive immune signaling 
      pathways, including nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), type I interferon, and 
      inflammasome. In this review, we provide an overview of the potential 
      interactions between gut microbiota and host immunity and how their crosstalk 
      could synergistically regulate inflammation and CRC, thus highlighting the 
      potential roles and mechanisms of gut microbiota in the development of 
      microbiota-based therapies to prevent or alleviate colitis and CRC.

AB  - Colorectal cancer (CRC) is highly prevalent worldwide. In 2018, there were over 
      1.8 million new cases. Most sporadic CRC develop from polypoid adenomas and are 
      preceded by intramucosal carcinoma (stage 0), which can progress into more 
      malignant forms. This developmental process is known as the adenoma-carcinoma 
      sequence. Early detection and endoscopic removal are crucial for CRC management. 
      Accumulating evidence suggests that the gut microbiota is associated with CRC 
      development in humans. Comprehensive characterization of this microbiota is of 
      great importance to assess its potential as a diagnostic marker in the very early 
      stages of CRC. In this review, we summarized recent studies on CRC-associated 
      bacteria and their carcinogenic mechanisms in animal models, human cell lines and 
      human cohorts. High-throughput technologies have facilitated the identification 
      of CRC-associated bacteria in human samples. We have presented our metagenome and 
      metabolome studies on fecal samples collected from a large Japanese cohort that 
      revealed stage-specific phenotypes of the microbiota in CRC. Furthermore, we have 
      discussed the potential carcinogenic mechanisms of the gut microbiota, from which 
      we can infer whether changes in the gut microbiota are a cause or effect in the 
      multi-step process of CRC carcinogenesis.

TI  - Methanogens as emerging pathogens in anaerobic abscesses.
PG  - 811-818
LID - 10.1007/s10096-019-03510-5 [doi]
AB  - Methanogens are strictly anaerobic archaea metabolising by-products of bacterial 
      fermentation into methane by using three known metabolic pathways, i.e. the 
      reduction of carbon dioxide, the fermentation of acetate or the dismutation of 
      methanol or methylamines. Methanogens described in human microbiota include only 
      Euryarchaeota, i.e. Methanobrevibacter smithii, Methanobrevibacter oralis, 
      Methanobrevibacter arbophilus, Methanobrevibacter massiliensis, 
      Methanomassiliicoccus luminyensis, Methanosphaera stadtmanae and Ca. 
      Methanomethylophilus alvus and Ca. Methanomassiliicoccus intestinalis. 
      Methanogens are emerging pathogens associated with brain and muscular abscesses. 
      They have been implicated in dysbiosis of the oral microbiota, periodontitis and 
      peri-implantitis. They have also been associated with dysbiosis of the digestive 
      tract microbiota linked to metabolic disorders (anorexia, malnutrition and 
      obesity) and with lesions of the digestive tract (colon cancer). Their detection 
      in anaerobic pus specimens and oral and digestive tract specimens relies on 
      microscopic examination by fluorescence in situ hybridisation, specific DNA 
      extraction followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based amplification of the 
      16S rRNA and mcrA gene fragments and isolation and culture in the supporting 
      presence of hydrogen-producing bacteria. Diagnostic identification can be 
      performed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass 
      spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and can be further completed by genotyping through 
      multi-spacer sequencing and, ultimately, whole genome sequencing (WGS). 
      Ornidazole derivatives, fusidic acid and rifampicin are the compounds to be 
      included in in vitro susceptibility testing to complete the clinical workflow. 
      Clinical microbiology laboratories should work toward developing cheap and easy 
      protocols for the routine detection and identification of methanogens in selected 
      specimens in order to refine the diagnosis of infections, as well as to expand 
      the knowledge about this group of intriguing microorganisms.

AB  - Colorectal cancer (CRC) ranks third among the most commonly occurring cancers 
      worldwide, and it causes half a million deaths annually. Alongside mechanistic 
      study for CRC detection and treatment by conventional techniques, new 
      technologies have been developed to study CRC. These technologies include 
      genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics which elucidate DNA 
      markers, RNA transcripts, protein and, metabolites produced inside the colon and 
      rectum part of the gut. All these approaches form the omics arena, which presents 
      a remarkable opportunity for the discovery of novel prognostic, diagnostic and 
      therapeutic biomarkers and also delineate the underlying mechanism of CRC 
      causation, which may further help in devising treatment strategies. This review 
      also mentions the latest developments in metagenomics and culturomics as emerging 
      evidence suggests that metagenomics of gut microbiota has profound implications 
      in the causation, prognosis, and treatment of CRC. A majority of bacteria cannot 
      be studied as they remain unculturable, so culturomics has also been strengthened 
      to develop culture conditions suitable for the growth of unculturable bacteria 
      and identify unknown bacteria. The overall purpose of this review is to 
      succinctly evaluate the application of omics technologies in colorectal cancer 
      research for improving the diagnosis and treatment strategies.

AB  - Background: The prevalence of rectal neuroendocrine tumors (RNET) has increased 
      substantially over the past decades. Little is known on mechanistic alteration in 
      the pathogenesis of such disease. We postulate that perturbations of human gut 
      microbiome-metabolome interface influentially affect the development of RNET. The 
      study aims to characterize the composition and function of faecal microbiome and 
      metabolites in RNET individuals. Methods: We performed deep shotgun metagenomic 
      sequencing and untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) 
      metabolomic profiling of faecal samples from the discovery cohort (18 RNET 
      patients, 40 controls), and validated the microbiome and metabolite-based 
      classifiers in an independent cohort (15 RNET participants, 19 controls). 
      Results: We uncovered a dysbiotic gut ecological microenvironment in RNET 
      patients, characterized by aberrant depletion and attenuated connection of 
      microbial species, and abnormally aggregated lipids and lipid-like molecules. 
      Functional characterization based on our in-house and Human Project Unified 
      Metabolic Analysis Network 2 (HUMAnN2) pipelines further indicated a nutrient 
      deficient gut microenvironment in RNET individuals, evidenced by diminished 
      activities such as energy metabolism, vitamin biosynthesis and transportation. By 
      integrating these data, we revealed 291 robust associations between 
      representative differentially abundant taxonomic species and metabolites, 
      indicating a tight interaction of gut microbiome with metabolites in RNET 
      pathogenesis. Finally, we identified a cluster of gut microbiome and 
      metabolite-based signatures, and replicated them in an independent cohort, 
      showing accurate prediction of such neoplasm from healthy people. Conclusions: 
      Our current study is the first to comprehensively characterize the perturbed 
      interface of gut microbiome and metabolites in RNET patients, which may provide 
      promising targets for microbiome-based diagnostics and therapies for this 
      disorder.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Resistance of colorectal cancer (CRC) cells to radiotherapy 
      considerably contributes to poor clinical outcomes of CRC patients. Microarray 
      profiling in this study revealed the differentially expressed forkhead box Q1 
      (FOXQ1) in CRC, and thus we aimed to illustrate the role of FOXQ1 in CRC by 
      modulating stemness and radio-resistance of CRC cells. METHODS: CRC and adjacent 
      normal tissues were collected from CRC patients, and the correlation between 
      FOXQ1 expression and CRC prognosis was analyzed. Subsequently, we determined the 
      expression of FOXQ1, sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and β-catenin in CRC tissues and cell 
      lines. The binding affinity between FOXQ1 and SIRT1 and that between SIRT1 and 
      β-catenin were validated with luciferase reporter gene, Co-IP and ChIP assays. 
      Following a metagenomics analysis of CRC intestinal microbiota, the effects of 
      the FOXQ1/SIRT1/β-catenin axis on CRC stem cell phenotypes and radio-resistance 
      was evaluated in vitro and in vivo through manipulation of gene expression. 
      Besides, mouse feces were collected to examine changes in intestinal microbiota. 
      RESULTS: FOXQ1 was highly expressed in CRC tissues and cells and positively 
      correlated with poor prognosis of CRC patients. FOXQ1 overexpression contributed 
      to resistance of CRC cells to radiation. Knockdown of FOXQ1 inhibited the 
      stemness of CRC cells and reversed their radio-resistance. FOXQ1 enhanced the 
      transcriptional expression of SIRT1, and SIRT1 enhanced the expression and 
      nuclear translocation of β-catenin. Knockdown of FOXQ1 repressed SIRT1 
      expression, thus reducing the stemness and radio-resistance of CRC cells. 
      Moreover, FOXQ1 knockdown suppressed CRC xenograft formation in xenograft-bearing 
      nude mice through inhibiting SIRT1 and β-catenin to reduce the content of 
      pathological bacteria that were up-regulated in CRC. CONCLUSION: FOXQ1-mediated 
      SIRT1 upregulation augments expression and nuclear translocation of β-catenin and 
      benefits CRC-related intestinal pathological bacterial, thereby enhancing the 
      stemness and radio-resistance of CRC cells.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a complex multifactorial disease. 
      Increasing evidence suggests that the microbiome is involved in different stages 
      of CRC initiation and progression. Beyond specific pro-oncogenic mechanisms found 
      in pathogens, metagenomic studies indicate the existence of a microbiome 
      signature, where particular bacterial taxa are enriched in the metagenomes of CRC 
      patients. Here, we investigate to what extent the abundance of bacterial taxa in 
      CRC metagenomes can be explained by the growth advantage resulting from the 
      presence of specific CRC metabolites in the tumor microenvironment. METHODS: We 
      composed lists of metabolites and bacteria that are enriched on CRC samples by 
      reviewing metabolomics experimental literature and integrating data from 
      metagenomic case-control studies. We computationally evaluated the growth effect 
      of CRC enriched metabolites on over 1500 genome-based metabolic models of human 
      microbiome bacteria. We integrated the metabolomics data and the mechanistic 
      models by using scores that quantify the response of bacterial biomass production 
      to CRC-enriched metabolites and used these scores to rank bacteria as potential 
      CRC passengers. RESULTS: We found that metabolic networks of bacteria that are 
      significantly enriched in CRC metagenomic samples either depend on metabolites 
      that are more abundant in CRC samples or specifically benefit from these 
      metabolites for biomass production. This suggests that metabolic alterations in 
      the cancer environment are a major component shaping the CRC microbiome. 
      CONCLUSION: Here, we show with in sillico models that supplementing the 
      intestinal environment with CRC metabolites specifically predicts the outgrowth 
      of CRC-associated bacteria. We thus mechanistically explain why a range of CRC 
      passenger bacteria are associated with CRC, enhancing our understanding of this 
      disease. Our methods are applicable to other microbial communities, since it 
      allows the systematic investigation of how shifts in the microbiome can be 
      explained from changes in the metabolome.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Stool samples from patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) have 
      a higher abundance of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius than stool from individuals 
      without CRC, based on metagenome sequencing. We investigated whether P anaerobius 
      contributes to colon tumor formation in mice and its possible mechanisms of 
      carcinogenesis. METHODS: We performed quantitative polymerase chain reaction 
      analyses to measure P anaerobius in 112 stool samples and 255 colon biopsies from 
      patients with CRC or advanced adenoma and from healthy individuals (controls) 
      undergoing colonoscopy examination at hospitals in Hong Kong and Beijing. C57BL/6 
      mice were given broad-spectrum antibiotics, followed by a single dose of 
      azoxymethane, to induce colon tumor formation. Three days later, mice were given 
      P anaerobius or Esherichia coli MG1655 (control bacteria), via gavage, for 6 
      weeks. Some mice were also given the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate 
      oxidase inhibitor apocynin. Intestine tissues were collected and analyzed 
      histologically. The colon epithelial cell line NCM460 and colon cancer cell lines 
      HT-29 and Caco-2 were exposed to P anaerobius or control bacteria; cells were 
      analyzed by immunoblot, proliferation, and bacterial attachment analyses and 
      compared in gene expression profiling studies. Gene expression was knocked down 
      in these cell lines with small interfering RNAs. RESULTS: P anaerobius was 
      significantly enriched in stool samples from patients with CRC and in biopsies 
      from patients with colorectal adenoma or CRC compared with controls. Mice 
      depleted of bacteria and exposed to azoxymethane and P anaerobius had a higher 
      incidence of intestinal dysplasia (63%) compared with mice not given the bacteria 
      (8.3%; P < .01). P anaerobius mainly colonized the colon compared with the rest 
      of the intestine. Colon cells exposed to P anaerobius had significantly higher 
      levels of proliferation than control cells. We found genes that regulate 
      cholesterol biosynthesis, Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling, and AMP-activated 
      protein kinase signaling to be significantly up-regulated in cells exposed to P 
      anaerobius. Total cholesterol levels were significantly increased in colon cell 
      lines exposed to P anaerobius via activation of sterol regulatory element-binding 
      protein 2. P anaerobius interacted with TLR2 and TLR4 to increase intracellular 
      levels of reactive oxidative species, which promoted cholesterol synthesis and 
      cell proliferation. Depletion of reactive oxidative species by knockdown of TLR2 
      or TLR4, or incubation of cells with an antioxidant, prevented P anaerobius from 
      inducing cholesterol biosynthesis and proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: Levels of P 
      anaerobius are increased in human colon tumor tissues and adenomas compared with 
      non-tumor tissues; this bacteria increases colon dysplasia in a mouse model of 
      CRC. P anaerobius interacts with TLR2 and TLR4 on colon cells to increase levels 
      of reactive oxidative species, which promotes cholesterol synthesis and cell 
      proliferation.

AB  - The human gut microbiota plays a dual key role in maintaining human health or 
      inducing disorders, for example, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cancers such as 
      colorectal cancer (CRC). High-throughput data analysis, such as metagenomics and 
      metabolomics, have shown the diverse effects of alterations in dynamic bacterial 
      populations on the initiation and progression of colorectal cancer. However, it 
      is well established that microbiome and human cells constantly influence each 
      other, so it is not appropriate to study them independently. Genome-scale 
      metabolic modeling is a well-established mathematical framework that describes 
      the dynamic behavior of these two axes at the system level. In this study, we 
      created community microbiome models of three conditions during colorectal cancer 
      progression, including carcinoma, adenoma and health status, and showed how 
      changes in the microbial population influence intestinal secretions. 
      Conclusively, our findings showed that alterations in the gut microbiome might 
      provoke mutations and transform adenomas into carcinomas. These alterations 
      include the secretion of mutagenic metabolites such as H(2)S, NO compounds, 
      spermidine and TMA (trimethylamine), as well as the reduction of butyrate. 
      Furthermore, we found that the colorectal cancer microbiome can promote 
      inflammation, cancer progression (e.g., angiogenesis) and cancer prevention 
      (e.g., apoptosis) by increasing and decreasing certain metabolites such as 
      histamine, glutamine and pyruvate. Thus, modulating the gut microbiome could be a 
      promising strategy for the prevention and treatment of CRC.

AB  - The mammalian microbiota plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of many 
      diseases. Thanks to recent advances in metagenomics, proteomics, and 
      metabolomics, microbiome composition and metabolic activity can now be studied in 
      detail. Results obtained by such fascinating and provocative studies would be 
      meaningless without considering the perspective of the whole organism. Our work 
      using gnotobiology as the major tool to unravel the mechanisms of host-microbe 
      interaction has demonstrated the crucial role of microbiota in the initiation and 
      progression of inflammation-associated colorectal neoplasia. Carcinogenesis in 
      the gut is driven by the presence of potentially harmful microbes or by lack of 
      protective ones, by the production of carcinogens generated by microbes, and by 
      the induction of inflammation and modulation of the immune system. Here, we 
      review these mechanisms with special emphasis on those where gnotobiology has 
      yielded important insights.

TI  - Harness the functions of gut microbiome in tumorigenesis for cancer treatment.
PG  - 937-967
LID - 10.1002/cac2.12200 [doi]
AB  - It has been shown that gut microbiota dysbiosis leads to physiological changes 
      and links to a number of diseases, including cancers. Thus, many cancer 
      categories and treatment regimens should be investigated in the context of the 
      microbiome. Owing to the availability of metagenome sequencing and multiomics 
      studies, analyses of species characterization, host genetic changes, and 
      metabolic profile of gut microbiota have become feasible, which has facilitated 
      an exponential knowledge gain about microbiota composition, taxonomic 
      alterations, and host interactions during tumorigenesis. However, the complexity 
      of the gut microbiota, with a plethora of uncharacterized host-microbe, 
      microbe-microbe, and environmental interactions, still contributes to the 
      challenge of advancing our knowledge of the microbiota-cancer interactions. These 
      interactions manifest in signaling relay, metabolism, immunity, tumor 
      development, genetic instability, sensitivity to cancer chemotherapy and 
      immunotherapy. This review summarizes current studies/molecular mechanisms 
      regarding the association between the gut microbiota and the development of 
      cancers, which provides insights into the therapeutic strategies that could be 
      harnessed for cancer diagnosis, treatment, or prevention.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Diverse research interests have converged on the gut 
      microbiota because of its contribution to immune development, mucosal homeostasis 
      and to the pathogenesis of a diversity of intestinal and extraintestinal 
      disorders. Recent landmark findings are addressed here. RECENT FINDINGS: The 
      impact of lifestyle, including dietary changes and antibiotics, on the microbiota 
      has been mechanistically linked with disease risk. Microbial, immune and 
      metabolic signalling are mutually interactive, with each of these being regulated 
      by diet. Although changes in the microbiota have been found in several disorders 
      and may have important therapeutic implications, some components of the commensal 
      microbiota may behave like pathogens (pathobionts) depending on the context and 
      host susceptibility. SUMMARY: Advances in understanding host-microbe interactions 
      in the gut continue apace, they are relevant to a diversity of infectious, 
      inflammatory, neoplastic and metabolic disorders and are poised for clinical 
      translation.

AB  - It is estimated that 20% of malignancies worldwide can be attributed to 
      infections, i.e. about 1.2 million cases per year. A typical example of the 
      association between bacterial infection and gastrointestinal malignancies is 
      Helicobacter pylori infection with both gastric cancer and mucosa-associated 
      lymphoid tissue lymphoma. Bacteria are an important component of the human body. 
      The human intestine contains >500 different types of microorganisms, the 'gut 
      microbiota', that play important functions such as energetic metabolism, 
      proliferation and survival of epithelial cells, and protection against pathogens. 
      Chronic alteration of intestinal microbiota homeostasis, 'dysbiosis', could 
      promote many diseases, including cancer. The mechanisms by which bacteria may 
      induce carcinogenesis include chronic inflammation, immune evasion, and immune 
      suppression. There are three effector pathways of T helper (Th) cell 
      differentiation: Th1 responses promoted by procarcinogenic signal transducer and 
      activator of transcription (Stat)1 and Stat4 signaling, Th2 responses promoted by 
      Stat6 signaling, and Th17 responses promoted by Stat3 signaling. Interestingly, 
      Th1 responses, driven by IL-12 and characterized by IFN-γ production, are 
      typically anticarcinogenic, whereas Th17 responses are activated in various 
      cancers. Furthermore, a T regulatory response, driven by IL-10 and TGF-β, 
      counterbalances the proinflammatory effect of Th17 responses. Elevated numbers of 
      T regulatory cells suppress the innate and adaptive immune responses, thereby 
      contributing to tumor progression. The emerging relationship between gut 
      microbiota and cancer has prompted new ways of thinking about cancer prevention 
      and has led to the development of noninvasive diagnostic tests and innovative 
      treatments, such as with probiotics. However, although in vitro and animal model 
      studies suggest a protective anticancer effect of probiotics, the results of 
      human epidemiological studies are controversial.

AB  - Systemic and local inflammation in relation to the resident microbiota of the 
      human gastro-intestinal (GI) tract and administration of probiotics are the main 
      themes of the present review. The dominating taxa of the human GI tract and their 
      potential for aggravating or suppressing inflammation are described. The review 
      focuses on human trials with probiotics and does not include in vitro studies and 
      animal experimental models. The applications of probiotics considered are 
      systemic immune-modulation, the metabolic syndrome, liver injury, inflammatory 
      bowel disease, colorectal cancer and radiation-induced enteritis. When the major 
      genomic differences between different types of probiotics are taken into account, 
      it is to be expected that the human body can respond differently to the different 
      species and strains of probiotics. This fact is often neglected in discussions of 
      the outcome of clinical trials with probiotics.

AB  - Gastrointestinal cancers account for around 40% of cancer-related deaths 
      worldwide, representing a global health burden. There is a growing body of 
      evidence highlighting the link between microbiota and gastrointestinal 
      tumorigenesis and/or resistance to therapy. In the present manuscript, we 
      reviewed the published studies on the relationship between the microbiota and the 
      different gastrointestinal tumors, namely, gastric, colorectal and esophageal, 
      including also the cancer of accessory organs such as liver and pancreas. There 
      is an emergent interest in the manipulation of gastrointestinal microflora in 
      order to understand the gastrointestinal tumorigenesis' processes and the 
      establishment of chemoresistance mechanisms.

TI  - Up-regulating the human intestinal microbiome using whole plant foods, 
      polyphenols, and/or fiber.
PG  - 8776-82
LID - 10.1021/jf2053959 [doi]
AB  - Whole plant foods, including fruit, vegetables, and whole grain cereals, protect 
      against chronic human diseases such as heart disease and cancer, with fiber and 
      polyphenols thought to contribute significantly. These bioactive food components 
      interact with the gut microbiota, with gut bacteria modifying polyphenol 
      bioavailability and activity, and with fiber, constituting the main energy source 
      for colonic fermentation. This paper discusses the consequences of increasing the 
      consumption of whole plant foods on the gut microbiota and subsequent 
      implications for human health. In humans, whole grain cereals can modify fecal 
      bacterial profiles, increasing relative numbers of bifidobacteria and 
      lactobacilli. Polyphenol-rich chocolate and certain fruits have also been shown 
      to increase fecal bifidobacteria. The recent FLAVURS study provides novel 
      information on the impact of high fruit and vegetable diets on the gut 
      microbiota. Increasing whole plant food consumption appears to up-regulate 
      beneficial commensal bacteria and may contribute toward the health effects of 
      these foods.

AB  - More than 100 trillion microorganisms inhabit the human intestinal tract and play 
      important roles in health conditions and diseases, including cancer. Accumulating 
      evidence demonstrates that specific bacteria and bacterial dysbiosis in the 
      gastrointestinal tract can potentiate the development and progression of 
      gastrointestinal tract neoplasms by damaging DNA, activating oncogenic signaling 
      pathways, producing tumor-promoting metabolites such as secondary bile acids, and 
      suppressing antitumor immunity. Other bacterial species have been shown to 
      produce short-chain fatty acids such as butyrate, which can suppress inflammation 
      and carcinogenesis in the gastrointestinal tract. Consistent with these lines of 
      evidence, clinical studies using metagenomic analyses have shown associations of 
      specific bacteria and bacterial dysbiosis with gastrointestinal tract cancers, 
      including esophageal, gastric, and colorectal cancers. Emerging data demonstrate 
      that intestinal bacteria can modulate the efficacy of cancer chemotherapies and 
      novel targeted immunotherapies such as anti-CTLA4 and anti-CD274 therapies, the 
      process of absorption, and the occurrence of complications after gastrointestinal 
      surgery. A better understanding of the mechanisms by which the gut microbiota 
      influence tumor development and progression in the intestine would provide 
      opportunities to develop new prevention and treatment strategies for patients 
      with gastrointestinal tract cancers by targeting the intestinal microflora.

TI  - Integrated paired-end enhancer profiling and whole-genome sequencing reveals

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Genomic structural variations (SVs) causing rewiring of cis-regulatory 
      elements remain largely unexplored in gastric cancer (GC). To identify SVs 
      affecting enhancer elements in GC (enhancer-based SVs), we integrated epigenomic 
      enhancer profiles revealed by paired-end H3K27ac ChIP-sequencing from primary GCs 
      with tumour whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data (PeNChIP-seq/WGS). DESIGN: We 
      applied PeNChIP-seq to 11 primary GCs and matched normal tissues combined with 
      WGS profiles of >200 GCs. Epigenome profiles were analysed alongside matched 
      RNA-seq data to identify tumour-associated enhancer-based SVs with altered cancer 
      transcription. Functional validation of candidate enhancer-based SVs was 
      performed using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, chromosome conformation capture 
      assays (4C-seq, Capture-C) and Hi-C analysis of primary GCs. RESULTS: 
      PeNChIP-seq/WGS revealed ~150 enhancer-based SVs in GC. The majority (63%) of SVs 
      linked to target gene deregulation were associated with increased tumour 
      expression. Enhancer-based SVs targeting CCNE1, a key driver of therapy 
      resistance, occurred in 8% of patients frequently juxtaposing diverse distal 
      enhancers to CCNE1 proximal regions. CCNE1-rearranged GCs were associated with 
      high CCNE1 expression, disrupted CCNE1 topologically associating domain (TAD) 
      boundaries, and novel TAD interactions in CCNE1-rearranged primary tumours. We 
      also observed IGF2 enhancer-based SVs, previously noted in colorectal cancer, 
      highlighting a common non-coding genetic driver alteration in gastric and 
      colorectal malignancies. CONCLUSION: Integrated paired-end NanoChIP-seq and WGS 
      of gastric tumours reveals tumour-associated regulatory SV in regions associated 
      with both simple and complex genomic rearrangements. Genomic rearrangements may 
      thus exploit enhancer-hijacking as a common mechanism to drive oncogene 
      expression in GC.

AB  - PURPOSE: Gut microbiota is predicted to play a key role in manifestation of 
      gastrointestinal tract cancers. The human gastrointestinal tract is a complex and 
      abundant network of microbial community. Gut microbiota depicts the microbe 
      population living in our intestine. Humans harbour more than 10(14) microbes in 
      the gut, and the diversity and densities of the microbiota increase from stomach 
      to colon. METHODS: The beneficial relationship between endogenous microbiota and 
      the eukaryotic hosts helps in maintaining various metabolic activities of the 
      body as well as temperature and pH balance. Studies using culturing methods have 
      suggested that the oesophagus is either sterile or contains only a few transient 
      microbes that originates from the oropharynx by swallowing or from the stomach by 
      gastroesophageal reflux. However, metagenomics suggest that large numbers of 
      uncultured organisms are harboured in the human gut. RESULTS: Observations 
      suggest that research directed towards manipulation of the gut microbiota can be 
      employed in prevention as well as treatment of these conditions. Well-designed, 
      randomized, placebo-controlled human studies using probiotics and/or prebiotics 
      are necessary to formulate the directions for prevention and therapy. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Change in gut microbes in gastrointestinal (GI) tract may have major 
      implication in gastric cancer, the fifth most occurring malignancy in the world. 
      Affected population manifests multiple conditions and diseases, which majorly 
      includes inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal malignancy.

AB  - The human intestine retains a complex microbial ecosystem, which performs crucial 
      functions that impact on host health. Several studies have indicated that 
      intestinal dysbiosis may impact on the establishment of life-threatening 
      intestinal diseases such as colorectal cancer. An adenomatous polyp is the result 
      of abnormal tissue growth, which is benign but is considered to be associated 
      with a high risk of developing colorectal cancer, based on its grade of 
      dysplasia. Development of diagnostic tools that are based on surveying the gut 
      microbiota and are aimed at early detection of colorectal cancer represent highly 
      desirable target. For this purpose, we performed a pilot study in which we 
      applied a metataxonomic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing approach to 
      unveil the composition of microbial communities of intestinal polyps. Moreover, 
      we performed a meta-analysis involving the reconstructed microbiota composition 
      of adenomatous polyps and publicly available metagenomics datasets of colorectal 
      cancer. These analyses allowed the identification of microbial taxa such as 
      Faecalibacterium, Bacteroides and Romboutsia, which appear to be depleted in 
      cancerogenic mucosa as well as in adenomatous polyps, thus representing novel 
      microbial biomarkers associated with early tumor formation. Furthermore, an 
      absolute quantification of Fusubacterium nucleatum in polyps further compounded 
      the important role of this microorganism as a valuable putative microbial 
      biomarker for early diagnosis of colorectal cancer.

AB  - The gut bacterial community is involved in the metabolism of bile acids and 
      short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Bile acids are involved in the absorption of fat 
      and the regulation of lipid homeostasis through emulsification and are 
      transformed into unconjugated bile acids by the gut microbiota. The gut 
      microbiota is actively involved in the production of bile acid metabolites, such 
      as deoxycholic acid, lithocholic acid, choline, and SCFAs such as acetate, 
      butyrate, and propionate. Metabolites derived from the gut microbiota or modified 
      gut microbiota metabolites contribute significantly to host pathophysiology. Gut 
      bacterial metabolites, such as deoxycholic acid, contribute to the development of 
      hepatocellular carcinoma and colon cancer by factors such as inflammation and 
      oxidative DNA damage. Butyrate, which is derived from gut bacteria such as 
      Megasphaera, Roseburia, Faecalibacterium, and Clostridium, is associated with the 
      activation of Treg cell differentiation in the intestine through histone 
      acetylation. Butyrate averts the action of class I histone deacetylases (HDAC), 
      such as HDAC1 and HDAC3, which are responsible for the transcription of genes 
      such as p21/Cip1, and cyclin D3 through hyperacetylation of histones, which 
      orchestrates G1 cell cycle arrest. It is essential to identify the interaction 
      between the gut microbiota and bile acid and SCFA metabolism to understand their 
      role in gastrointestinal carcinogenesis including colon, gastric, and liver 
      cancer. Metagenomic approaches with bioinformatic analyses are used to identify 
      the bacterial species in the metabolism of bile acids and SCFAs. This review 
      provides an overview of the current knowledge of gut microbiota-derived bile acid 
      metabolism in tumor development and whether it can stand as a marker for 
      carcinogenesis. Additionally, this review assesses the evidence of gut 
      microbiota-derived short-chain fatty acids including butyric acid in antitumor 
      activity. Future research is required to identify the beneficial commensal gut 
      bacteria and their metabolites which will be considered to be therapeutic targets 
      in inflammation-mediated gastrointestinal cancers.

AB  - Compelling research over the past decade identified a fundamental role of the 
      intestinal microbiome on human health. Compositional and functional changes of 
      this microbial ecosystem are correlated with a variety of human pathologies. 
      Metagenomic resolution and bioinformatic tools considerably improved, allowing 
      even strain-level analysis. However, the search for microbial risk patterns in 
      human cohorts is often confounded by environmental factors (eg, medication) and 
      host status (eg, disease relapse), questioning the prognostic and therapeutic 
      value of the currently available information. In addition to a better 
      stratification of human phenotypes, the implementation of standardized protocols 
      for sampling and analysis is needed to improve the reproducibility and 
      comparability of microbiome signatures at a meaningful taxonomic resolution. At 
      the level of mechanistic understanding, the molecular integration of pleiotropic 
      signals coming from this complex and dynamically changing ecosystem is one of the 
      biggest challenges in this field. The first successful attempts to apply reverse 
      genetics based on the available metagenomic information yielded identification of 
      small molecules and metabolites with functional relevance for microbe-host 
      interactions. Further expansion on the isolation of bacteria from the 
      "unculturable biomass" will help characterize microbiome signatures in model 
      systems, finally aiming at the development of clinically relevant synthetic 
      consortia with safe and functionally well-defined strains. In conclusion and 
      beyond reasonable enthusiasm, the mechanistic implementation and clinical 
      relevance of microbiome alterations on disease susceptibility is still in its 
      infancy, but the integration of all the above-mentioned strategies will help 
      overcome the correlation era in microbiome research and lead to a rational 
      evaluation of clinical strategies relevant for targeted microbial intervention.

AB  - Recent advances in our ability to identify and characterize the human microbiota 
      have transformed our appreciation of the function of the colon from an organ 
      principally involved in the reabsorption of secretory fluids to a metabolic organ 
      on a par with the liver. High-throughput technology has been applied to the 
      identification of specific differences in microbial DNA, allowing the 
      identification of trillions of microbes belonging to more than 1000 different 
      species, with a metabolic mass of approximately 1.5 kg. The close proximity of 
      these microbes with the mucosa and gut lymphoid tissue helps explain why a 
      balanced microbiota is likely to preserve mucosal health, whereas an unbalanced 
      composition, as seen in dysbiosis, may increase the prevalence of diseases not 
      only of the mucosa but also within the body due to the strong interactions with 
      the gut immune system, the largest immune organ of the body. Such abnormalities 
      have been pinpointed as etiological factors in a wide range of diseases, 
      including autoimmune disorders, allergy, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory 
      bowel disease, obesity, and colon cancer. Recognition of the strong potential for 
      food to manipulate microbiota composition has opened up new therapeutic 
      strategies against these diseases based on dietary intervention.

AB  - The gut microbiota has been associated with colorectal cancer (CRC), but causal 
      alterations preceding CRC have not been elucidated. To prospectively assess 
      microbiome changes prior to colorectal neoplasia, we investigated samples from 
      100 Lynch syndrome patients using 16S rRNA gene sequencing of colon biopsies, 
      coupled with metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing of feces. Colectomy 
      and CRC history represented the largest effects on microbiome profiles. A subset 
      of Clostridiaceae were depleted in stool corresponding with baseline adenomas, 
      while Desulfovibrio was enriched both in stool and in mucosal biopsies. A 
      classifier leveraging stool metatranscriptomes resulted in modest power to 
      predict interval development of preneoplastic colonic adenoma. Predictive 
      transcripts corresponded with a shift in flagellin contributors and oxidative 
      metabolic microenvironment, potentially factors in local CRC pathogenesis. This 
      suggests that the effectiveness of prospective microbiome monitoring for adenomas 
      may be limited but supports the potential causality of these consistent, early 
      microbial changes in colonic neoplasia.

TI  - Birthweight, childhood overweight, height and growth and adult cancer risks: a 
      review of studies using the Copenhagen School Health Records Register.
PG  - 1546-1560
LID - 10.1038/s41366-020-0523-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most identified risk factors for cancer primarily occur in adulthood. 
      As cancers generally have long latency periods, it is possible that risk factors 
      acting earlier in life and accumulation of risks across the life course are 
      important. Thus, focusing only on adult overweight as a modifiable risk factor 
      may overlook childhood as an important aetiologic time window when body size is 
      relevant for future cancer risks. The objective of this study was to review the 
      evidence for associations between birthweight, body mass index (BMI), height and 
      growth from 7-13 years and adult cancer risks based on studies using the 
      Copenhagen School Health Records Register. METHODS: The register contains 
      measured anthropometric information on 372,636 children born in 1930-1989. All 
      studies examining associations between early life body size and risks of adult 
      cancer (until 85 years, diagnosed in 1968-2015) were included, comprising 31 
      studies on 16 different cancer sites. Cancer diagnoses were retrieved via 
      individual-level linkages to the Danish Cancer Registry. RESULTS: Birthweight was 
      differentially associated with bladder, breast, colon, glioma, Hodgkin's disease, 
      liver, kidney (renal cell), melanoma, ovarian, rectal, testicular and thyroid 
      cancer. BMI in childhood was positively associated with risks of bladder (only 
      late childhood), colon, endometrial, kidney, liver, oesophageal (only late 
      childhood), ovarian, pancreatic (<70 years), prostate (only before childhood 
      height adjustment) and thyroid cancer, whereas it was inversely associated with 
      breast cancer. Child height was positively associated with breast, colon, 
      endometrial, glioma, Hodgkin's disease, kidney, melanoma, oesophageal (only 
      women), ovarian, prostate, testicular and thyroid cancer and inversely associated 
      with bladder cancer. Greater than average increases in childhood BMI or linear 
      growth at ages 7-13 increased risks of several cancers. CONCLUSIONS: Early life 
      body size and growth are associated with many, but not all adult cancers, 
      suggesting that the aetiology of several cancers may lie earlier in life than 
      previously thought.

AB  - The human colon harbors a diverse array of microorganisms that play fundamental 
      roles in colorectal cancer (CRC). Increasing evidence indicates that dysbiosis of 
      the intestinal microbiome has been associated with the development of CRC. 
      Interaction between host genetics, intestinal microbiota, and lifestyle is 
      well-indicated in the influence, prevention, and treatment of CRC. Various 
      microbiome compositions have reported anticancer and/or anti-inflammatory 
      properties. The presence of our microbiota is integral to our development, but a 
      change in its composition can often lead to adverse effects, increasing the 
      propensity for serious diseases like cancers. Recently, molecular detection and 
      metabolomic techniques have increased our knowledge of the role of microbiota in 
      promoting tumorigenesis. Dietary interventions may be appropriate to regulate the 
      growth of beneficial microbiota in the gut. Metagenomic approaches along with 
      immunology and metabolomics will obvious a new path for the treatment of CRC. In 
      this study, we summarized recent advances in understanding the mechanisms 
      involved in microbiota-related colorectal carcinoma, based on evidence from 
      immunotherapy studies.

TI  - Metagenomics analysis of cultured mucosal bacteria from colorectal cancer and 
      adjacent normal mucosal tissues.
LID - 10.1099/jmm.0.001523 [doi]
AB  - Introduction. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancers 
      worldwide. Multiple risk factors are involved in CRC development, including age, 
      genetics, lifestyle, diet and environment. Of these, the role of the gut 
      microbiota in cancer biology is increasingly recognized.Hypothesis/Gap Statement. 
      Micro-organisms have been widely detected in stool samples, but few mucosal 
      samples have been detected and sequenced in depth.Aim. Analysis of cultured 
      mucosal bacteria from colorectal cancer and adjacent normal mucosal tissues with 
      metagenomics sequencing.Methodology. Twenty-eight paired tumour and non-tumour 
      tissues from 14 patients undergoing surgery for CRC were analysed. We removed the 
      influence of eukaryotic cells via culture. The composition of mucosal microbiota 
      in intestinal mucosa were detected and analysed with metagenomic 
      sequencing.Results. Compared with non-cultured mucosal sample, 80 % bacteria 
      species could be detected after culture. Moreover, after culture, additional 30 % 
      bacteria could be detected, compared with non-cultured samples. Since after 
      culture it was difficult to estimate the original abundance of microbiome, we 
      focused on the identification of the CRC tissue-specific species. There were 298 
      bacterial species, which could only be cultured and detected in CRC tissues. 
      Myroides odoratimimus and Cellulophaga baltica could be isolated from all the 
      tumour samples of 14 CRC patients, suggesting that these species may be related 
      to tumour occurrence and development. Further functional analysis indicated that 
      bacteria from CRC tissues showed more active functions, including basic 
      metabolism, signal transduction and survival activities.Conclusion. We used a new 
      method based on culture to implement information on prokaryotic taxa, and related 
      functions, which samples were from colorectal tissues. This method is suitable 
      for removing eukaryotic contamination and detecting micro-organisms from other 
      tissues.

AB  - Metagenomics which combines the power of genomics, bioinformatics, and systems 
      biology, provide new access to the microbial world. Metagenomics permit the 
      genetic analysis of complex microbial populations without requiring prior 
      cultivation. Through the conceptual innovations in metagenomics and the 
      improvements in DNA high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics analysis 
      technology, gastrointestinal microbiology has entered the metagenomics era and 
      become a hot topic worldwide. Human microbiome research is underway, however, 
      most studies in this area have focused on the composition and function of the 
      intestinal microbiota and the relationship between intestinal microbiota and 
      metabolic diseases (obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, etc.) and intestinal 
      disorders [inflammatory bowel disease, colorectal cancer, irritable bowel 
      syndrome (IBS), etc.]. Few investigations on microbiota have been conducted 
      within the upper gastrointestinal tract (esophagus, stomach and duodenum). The 
      upper gastrointestinal microbiota is essential for several gastrointestinal 
      illnesses, including esophagitis, Barrett's esophagus, and esophageal carcinoma, 
      gastritis and gastric cancer, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, IBS and 
      celiac disease. However, the constitution and diversity of the microbiota in 
      different sections of the upper gastrointestinal tract under health and various 
      disease states, as well as the function of microbiota in the pathogenesis of 
      various digestive diseases are still undefined. The current article provides an 
      overview of the recent findings regarding the relationship between upper 
      gastrointestinal microbiota and gastrointestinal diseases; and discusses the 
      study limitations and future directions of upper gastrointestinal microbiota 
      research.

TI  - The human gut sterolbiome: bile acid-microbiome endocrine aspects and 
      therapeutics.
PG  - 99-105

AB  - The human body is now viewed as a complex ecosystem that on a cellular and gene 
      level is mainly prokaryotic. The mammalian liver synthesizes and secretes 
      hydrophilic primary bile acids, some of which enter the colon during the 
      enterohepatic circulation, and are converted into numerous hydrophobic 
      metabolites which are capable of entering the portal circulation, returned to the 
      liver, and in humans, accumulating in the biliary pool. Bile acids are hormones 
      that regulate their own synthesis, transport, in addition to glucose and lipid 
      homeostasis, and energy balance. The gut microbial community through their 
      capacity to produce bile acid metabolites distinct from the liver can be thought 
      of as an "endocrine organ" with potential to alter host physiology, perhaps to 
      their own favor. We propose the term "sterolbiome" to describe the genetic 
      potential of the gut microbiome to produce endocrine molecules from endogenous 
      and exogenous steroids in the mammalian gut. The affinity of secondary bile acid 
      metabolites to host nuclear receptors is described, the potential of secondary 
      bile acids to promote tumors, and the potential of bile acids to serve as 
      therapeutic agents are discussed.

LID - 10.1007/82_2011_192 [doi]
AB  - The number of microorganisms inhabiting the human digestive tract exceeds the 
      number of body cells by a factor of ten. This microbial community affects host 
      physiology and host health. The metabolic potential of the gut microbiota is 
      immense affording the extraction of energy from otherwise indigestible 
      carbohydrates (dietary fiber) and the conversion of host-derived substances, 
      non-nutritive dietary components and drugs. Recognized functions of the gut 
      microbiota include provision of colonization resistance against pathogens and 
      priming of both the innate and the acquired immune systems. However, the 
      intestinal microbiota may also contribute to the development of diseases such as 
      ulcerative colitis and colorectal cancer. Culture-dependent studies provided 
      basic knowledge on the gut microbiota, but only the advent of culture-independent 
      molecular methods led to a better understanding of host-microbe interactions. The 
      application of metagenomics to the gut microbial ecosystem revealed truly 
      remarkable correlations between certain diseases and the gut microbiome. It also 
      led to the suggestion of the existence of a 'core microbiome' that encompasses 
      key functions shared by each individual. However, the mechanisms underlying 
      host-microbe interactions have not yet been unraveled.

TI  - [Gut microbial influence and probiotics on colorectal cancer].
PG  - 275-84
AB  - The human intestinal microbiota is a community of 10(13)-10(14) microorganisms 
      that harbor in the intestine and normally participate in a symbiotic relationship 
      with human. Technical and conceptual advances have enabled rapid progress in 
      characterizing the taxonomic composition, metabolic capacity and immunomodulatory 
      activity of the human intestinal microbiota. Their collective genome, defined as 
      microbiome, is estimated to contain ≥150 times as many genes as 2.85 billion base 
      pair human genome. The intestinal microbiota and its microbiome form a diverse 
      and complex ecological community that profoundly impact intestinal homeostasis 
      and disease states. It is becoming increasingly evident that the large and 
      complex bacterial population of the large intestine plays an important role in 
      colorectal carcinogenesis. Numerous studies show that gut immunity and 
      inflammation have impact on the development of colorectal cancer. Additionally, 
      bacteria have been linked to colorectal cancer by the production of toxic and 
      genotoxic bacterial metabolite. In this review, we discuss the multifactorial 
      role of intestinal microbiota in colorectal cancer and role for probiotics in the 
      prevention of colorectal cancer.

TI  - Nutrition and colonic health: the critical role of the microbiota.
PG  - 51-8
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To highlight mechanisms whereby diet affects colonic function 
      and disease patterns. RECENT FINDINGS: Topical nutrients are preferentially used 
      by the gut mucosa to maintain structure and function. With the colon, topical 
      nutrients are generated by the colonic microbiota to maintain mucosal health. 
      Most importantly, short chain fatty acids control proliferation and 
      differentiation, thereby reducing colon cancer risk. In patients with massive 
      loss of small intestine, short chain fatty acid production supports survival by 
      releasing up to 1000 kcal energy/day. Human studies show that the microbiota 
      synthesizes a large pool of utilizable folate which may support survival in 
      impoverished populations. Unfortunately, the microbiota may also elaborate toxic 
      products from food residues such as genotoxic hydrogen sulfide by sulfur-reducing 
      bacteria in response to a high-meat diet. The employment of culture-free 
      techniques based on 16S regions of DNA has revealed that our colons harbor over 
      800 bacterial species and 7000 different strains. Evidence suggests that the diet 
      directly influences the diversity of the microbiota, providing the link between 
      diet, colonic disease, and colon cancer. The microbiota, however, can determine 
      the efficiency of food absorption and risk of obesity. SUMMARY: Our 
      investigations have focused on a small number of bacterial species: 
      characterization of microbiota and its metabolism can be expected to provide the 
      key to colonic health and disease.

TI  - Parvimonas micra promotes colorectal tumorigenesis and is associated with 
      prognosis of colorectal cancer patients.
PG  - 4200-4210
LID - 10.1038/s41388-022-02395-7 [doi]
AB  - Large-scale fecal shotgun metagenomic sequencing revealed the high abundance of 
      Parvimonas micra in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. We investigated the role 
      and clinical significance of P. micra in colorectal tumorigenesis. The abundance 
      of P. micra was examined in 309 fecal samples and 165 colon biopsy tissues of CRC 
      patients and healthy subjects. P. micra was significantly enriched in fecal 
      samples from 128 CRC patients compared to 181 healthy subjects (P < 0.0001); and 
      in colon tissue biopsies from 52 CRC patients compared to 61 healthy subjects 
      (P < 0.0001). Multivariate analysis showed that P. micra is an independent risk 
      factor of poor survival in CRC patients (Hazard Ratio: 1.93). P. micra strain was 
      isolated from feces of a CRC patient. Apc(min/+) mice gavaged with P. micra 
      showed significantly higher tumor burden and tumor load (both P < 0.01). 
      Consistently, gavage of P. micra significantly promoted colonocyte proliferation 
      in conventional mice, which was further confirmed by germ-free mice. P. micra 
      colonization up-regulated genes involved in cell proliferation, stemness, 
      angiogenesis and invasiveness/metastasis; and enhanced Th17 cells infiltration 
      and expression of Th17 cells-secreted cytokines (Il-17, Il-22, and Il-23) in the 
      colon of Apc(min/+), conventional and germ-free mice. P. micra-conditioned medium 
      significantly promoted the differentiation of CD4(+) T cells to Th17 cells 
      (IL-17(+)CD4(+) phenotype) and enhanced the oncogenic Wnt signaling pathway. In 
      conclusion, P. micra promoted colorectal tumorigenesis in mice by inducing 
      colonocyte proliferation and altering Th17 immune response. P. micra may act as a 
      prognostic biomarker for poor survival of CRC patients.

AB  - Pathogenesis of colorectal cancer (CRC) is associated with alterations in gut 
      microbiome. Previous studies have focused on the changes of taxonomic abundances 
      by metagenomics. Variations of the function of intestinal bacteria in CRC 
      patients compared to healthy crowds remain largely unknown. Here we collected 
      fecal samples from CRC patients and healthy volunteers and characterized their 
      microbiome using quantitative metaproteomic method. We have identified and 
      quantified 91,902 peptides, 30,062 gut microbial protein groups, and 195 genera 
      of microbes. Among the proteins, 341 were found significantly different in 
      abundance between the CRC patients and the healthy volunteers. Microbial proteins 
      related to iron intake/transport; oxidative stress; and DNA replication, 
      recombination, and repair were significantly alternated in abundance as a result 
      of high local concentration of iron and high oxidative stress in the large 
      intestine of CRC patients. Our study shows that metaproteomics can provide 
      functional information on intestinal microflora that is of great value for 
      pathogenesis research, and can help guide clinical diagnosis in the future.

AB  - The human gastrointestinal tract harbors a complex and abundant microbial 
      community reaching as high as 10(13)-10(14) microorganisms in the colon. This 
      endogenous microbiota forms a symbiotic relationship with their eukaryotic host 
      and this close partnership helps maintain homeostasis by performing essential and 
      non-redundant tasks (e.g. nutrition/energy and, immune system balance, pathogen 
      exclusion). Although this relationship is essential and beneficial to the host, 
      various events (e.g. infection, diet, stress, inflammation) may impact microbial 
      composition, leading to the formation of a dysbiotic microbiota, further 
      impacting on health and disease states. For example, Crohn's disease and 
      ulcerative colitis, collectively termed inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), have 
      been associated with the establishment of a dysbiotic microbiota. In addition, 
      extra-intestinal disorders such as obesity and metabolic syndrome are also 
      associated with the development of a dysbiotic microbiota. Consequently, there is 
      an increasing interest in harnessing the power of the microbiome and modulating 
      its composition as a means to alleviate intestinal pathologies/disorders and 
      maintain health status. In this review, we will discuss the emerging relationship 
      between the microbiota and development of colorectal cancer as well as present 
      evidence that microbial manipulation (probiotic, prebiotic) impacts disease 
      development.

AB  - Gastrointestinal microbiome, containing at least 100 trillion bacteria, resides 
      in the mucosal surface of human intestine. Recent studies show that perturbations 
      in the microbiota may influence physiology and link to a number of diseases, 
      including colon tumorigenesis. Colorectal cancer (CRC), the third most common 
      cancer, is the disease resulting from multi-genes and multi-factors, but the 
      mechanistic details between gut microenvironment and CRC remain poorly 
      characterized. Thanks to new technologies such as metagenome sequencing, progress 
      in large-scale analysis of the genetic and metabolic profile of gut microbial has 
      been possible, which has facilitated studies about microbiota composition, 
      taxonomic alterations and host interactions. Different bacterial species and 
      their metabolites play critical roles in the development of CRC. Also, microbiota 
      is important in the inflammatory response and immune processes deregulation 
      during the development and progression of CRC. This review summarizes current 
      studies regarding the association between gastrointestinal microbiota and the 
      development of CRC, which provides insights into the therapeutic strategy of CRC.

AB  - Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the most common type cancers in the world. CRC occurs 
      sporadically in the majority of cases, indicating the predominant cause of the 
      disease are environmental factors. Diet-induced changes in gut-microbiome are 
      recently supposed to contribute on epidemics of CRC. This study was aimed to 
      investigate the association of metagenomics and metabolomics in gut extracellular 
      vesicles (EVs) of CRC and healthy subjects. A total of 40 healthy volunteers and 
      32 patients with CRC were enrolled in this study. Metagenomic profiling by 
      sequencing 16 S rDNA was performed for assessing microbial codiversity. We 
      explored the small molecule metabolites using gas chromatography-time-of-flight 
      mass spectrometry. In total, stool EVs were prepared from 40 healthy volunteers 
      and 32 patients with CRC. Metagenomic profiling demonstrated that bacterial 
      phyla, particularly of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria, were significantly altered 
      in patients with colorectal cancer. Through metabolomics profiling, we determined 
      seven amino acids, four carboxylic acids, and four fatty acids; including 
      short-chain to long chain fatty acids that altered in the disease group. Binary 
      logistic regression was further tested to evaluate the diagnostic performance. In 
      summary, the present findings suggest that gut flora dysbiosis may result in 
      alternation of amino acid metabolism, which may be correlated with the 
      pathogenesis of CRC.

AB  - Probiotics are beneficial components of the microbiota that have been used for 
      centuries because of the health benefits they confer to the host. Only recently, 
      however, has the contribution of probiotics to modulation of immunological, 
      respiratory, and gastrointestinal functions started to be fully appreciated and 
      scientifically evaluated. Probiotics such as Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 and 
      lactic acid bacteria are currently used to, or have been evaluated for use to, 
      prevent or treat a range of intestinal maladies including inflammatory bowel 
      disease, constipation, and colon cancer. Engineering these natural probiotics to 
      produce immunomodulatory molecules may help to further increase the benefit to 
      the host. In this article, we will discuss some of the mechanisms of action of 
      probiotics as well as advances in the rational design of probiotics.

AB  - To gain insight into the complex microbiome-gut-brain axis in irritable bowel 
      syndrome (IBS), several modalities of biological and clinical data must be 
      combined. We aimed to identify profiles of fecal microbiota and metabolites 
      associated with IBS and to delineate specific phenotypes of IBS that represent 
      potential pathophysiological mechanisms. Fecal metabolites were measured using 
      proton nuclear magnetic resonance ((1)H-NMR) spectroscopy and gut microbiome 
      using shotgun metagenomic sequencing (MGS) in a combined dataset of 142 IBS 
      patients and 120 healthy controls (HCs) with extensive clinical, biological and 
      phenotype information. Data were analyzed using support vector classification and 
      regression and kernel t-SNE. Microbiome and metabolome profiles could distinguish 
      IBS and HC with an area-under-the-receiver-operator-curve of 77.3% and 79.5%, 
      respectively, but this could be improved by combining microbiota and metabolites 
      to 83.6%. No significant differences in predictive ability of the 
      microbiome-metabolome data were observed between the three classical, stool 
      pattern-based, IBS subtypes. However, unsupervised clustering showed distinct 
      subsets of IBS patients based on fecal microbiome-metabolome data. These clusters 
      could be related plasma levels of serotonin and its metabolite 
      5-hydroxyindoleacetate, effects of psychological stress on gastrointestinal (GI) 
      symptoms, onset of IBS after stressful events, medical history of previous 
      abdominal surgery, dietary caloric intake and IBS symptom duration. Furthermore, 
      pathways in metabolic reaction networks were integrated with microbiota data, 
      that reflect the host-microbiome interactions in IBS. The identified 
      microbiome-metabolome signatures for IBS, associated with altered serotonin 
      metabolism and unfavorable stress response related to GI symptoms, support the 
      microbiota-gut-brain link in the pathogenesis of IBS.

TI  - Integration of microbiology, molecular pathology, and epidemiology: a new 
      paradigm to explore the pathogenesis of microbiome-driven neoplasms.
PG  - 615-628
LID - 10.1002/path.5236 [doi]
AB  - Molecular pathological epidemiology (MPE) is an integrative transdisciplinary 
      field that addresses heterogeneous effects of exogenous and endogenous factors 
      (collectively termed 'exposures'), including microorganisms, on disease 
      occurrence and consequences, utilising molecular pathological signatures of the 
      disease. In parallel with the paradigm of precision medicine, findings from MPE 
      research can provide aetiological insights into tailored strategies of disease 
      prevention and treatment. Due to the availability of molecular pathological tests 
      on tumours, the MPE approach has been utilised predominantly in research on 
      cancers including breast, lung, prostate, and colorectal carcinomas. Mounting 
      evidence indicates that the microbiome (inclusive of viruses, bacteria, fungi, 
      and parasites) plays an important role in a variety of human diseases including 
      neoplasms. An alteration of the microbiome may be not only a cause of neoplasia 
      but also an informative biomarker that indicates or mediates the association of 
      an epidemiological exposure with health conditions and outcomes. To adequately 
      educate and train investigators in this emerging area, we herein propose the 
      integration of microbiology into the MPE model (termed 'microbiology-MPE'), which 
      could improve our understanding of the complex interactions of environment, 
      tumour cells, the immune system, and microbes in the tumour microenvironment 
      during the carcinogenic process. Using this approach, we can examine how 
      lifestyle factors, dietary patterns, medications, environmental exposures, and 
      germline genetics influence cancer development and progression through impacting 
      the microbial communities in the human body. Further integration of other 
      disciplines (e.g. pharmacology, immunology, nutrition) into microbiology-MPE 
      would expand this developing research frontier. With the advent of 
      high-throughput next-generation sequencing technologies, researchers now have 
      increasing access to large-scale metagenomics as well as other omics data (e.g. 
      genomics, epigenomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) in population-based 
      research. The integrative field of microbiology-MPE will open new opportunities 
      for personalised medicine and public health. Copyright © 2019 Pathological

TI  - Stool microRNA profiles reflect different dietary and gut microbiome patterns in 
      healthy individuals.
PG  - 1302-1314
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2021-325168 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: MicroRNA (miRNA) profiles have been evaluated in several biospecimens 
      in relation to common diseases for which diet may have a considerable impact. We 
      aimed at characterising how specific diets are associated with the miRNome in 
      stool of vegans, vegetarians and omnivores and how this is reflected in the gut 
      microbial composition, as this is still poorly explored. DESIGN: We performed 
      small RNA and shotgun metagenomic sequencing in faecal samples and dietary 
      recording from 120 healthy volunteers, equally distributed for the different 
      diets and matched for sex and age. RESULTS: We found 49 miRNAs differentially 
      expressed among vegans, vegetarians and omnivores (adj. p <0.05) and confirmed 
      trends of expression levels of such miRNAs in vegans and vegetarians compared 
      with an independent cohort of 45 omnivores. Two miRNAs related to lipid 
      metabolism, miR-636 and miR-4739, were inversely correlated to the non-omnivorous 
      diet duration, independently of subject age. Seventeen miRNAs correlated 
      (|rho|>0.22, adj. p <0.05) with the estimated intake of nutrients, particularly 
      animal proteins, phosphorus and, interestingly, lipids. In omnivores, higher 
      Prevotella and Roseburia and lower Bacteroides abundances than in vegans and 
      vegetarians were observed. Lipid metabolism-related miR-425-3p and miR-638 
      expression levels were associated with increased abundances of microbial species, 
      such as Roseburia sp. CAG 182 and Akkermansia muciniphila, specific of different 
      diets. An integrated analysis identified 25 miRNAs, 25 taxa and 7 dietary 
      nutrients that clearly discriminated (area under the receiver operating 
      characteristic curve=0.89) the three diets. CONCLUSION: Stool miRNA profiles are 
      associated with specific diets and support the role of lipids as a driver of 
      epigenetic changes and host-microbial molecular interactions in the gut.

TI  - Diet, microbiota, and microbial metabolites in colon cancer risk in rural 
      Africans and African Americans.
PG  - 111-20
LID - 10.3945/ajcn.112.056689 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Epidemiologic studies have suggested that most cases of sporadic 
      colon cancer can be attributed to diet. The recognition that colonic microbiota 
      have a major influence on colonic health suggests that they might mediate colonic 
      carcinogenesis. OBJECTIVE: To examine the hypothesis that the influence of diet 
      on colon cancer risk is mediated by the microbiota through their metabolites, we 
      measured differences in colonic microbes and their metabolites in African 
      Americans with a high risk and in rural native Africans with a low risk of colon 
      cancer. DESIGN: Fresh fecal samples were collected from 12 healthy African 
      Americans aged 50-65 y and from 12 age- and sex-matched native Africans. 
      Microbiomes were analyzed with 16S ribosomal RNA gene pyrosequencing together 
      with quantitative polymerase chain reaction of the major fermentative, 
      butyrate-producing, and bile acid-deconjugating bacteria. Fecal short-chain fatty 
      acids were measured by gas chromatography and bile acids by liquid 
      chromatography-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Microbial composition was 
      fundamentally different, with a predominance of Prevotella in native Africans 
      (enterotype 2) and of Bacteroides in African Americans (enterotype 1). Total 
      bacteria and major butyrate-producing groups were significantly more abundant in 
      fecal samples from native Africans. Microbial genes encoding for secondary bile 
      acid production were more abundant in African Americans, whereas those encoding 
      for methanogenesis and hydrogen sulfide production were higher in native 
      Africans. Fecal secondary bile acid concentrations were higher in African 
      Americans, whereas short-chain fatty acids were higher in native Africans. 
      CONCLUSION: Our results support the hypothesis that colon cancer risk is 
      influenced by the balance between microbial production of health-promoting 
      metabolites such as butyrate and potentially carcinogenic metabolites such as 
      secondary bile acids.

TI  - The intestinal microbiota, gastrointestinal environment and colorectal cancer: a 
      putative role for probiotics in prevention of colorectal cancer?
PG  - G401-24
LID - 10.1152/ajpgi.00110.2011 [doi]
AB  - Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in the United 
      States, and, even though 5-15% of the total CRC cases can be attributed to 
      individual genetic predisposition, environmental factors could be considered 
      major factors in susceptibility to CRC. Lifestyle factors increasing the risks of 
      CRC include elevated body mass index, obesity, and reduced physical activity. 
      Additionally, a number of dietary elements have been associated with higher or 
      lower incidence of CRC. In this context, it has been suggested that diets high in 
      fruit and low in meat might have a protective effect, reducing the incidence of 
      colorectal adenomas by modulating the composition of the normal nonpathogenic 
      commensal microbiota. In addition, it has been demonstrated that changes in 
      abundance of taxonomic groups have a profound impact on the gastrointestinal 
      physiology, and an increasing number of studies are proposing that the microbiota 
      mediates the generation of dietary factors triggering colon cancer. 
      High-throughput sequencing and molecular taxonomic technologies are rapidly 
      filling the knowledge gaps left by conventional microbiology techniques to obtain 
      a comprehensive catalog of the human intestinal microbiota and their associated 
      metabolic repertoire. The information provided by these studies will be essential 
      to identify agents capable of modulating the massive amount of gut bacteria in 
      safe noninvasive manners to prevent CRC. Probiotics, defined as "live 
      microorganisms which, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health 
      benefit on the host" (219), are capable of transient modulation of the 
      microbiota, and their beneficial effects include reinforcement of the natural 
      defense mechanisms and protection against gastrointestinal disorders. Probiotics 
      have been successfully used to manage infant diarrhea, food allergies, and 
      inflammatory bowel disease; hence, the purpose of this review was to examine 
      probiotic metabolic activities that may have an effect on the prevention of CRC 
      by scavenging toxic compounds or preventing their generation in situ. 
      Additionally, a brief consideration is given to safety evaluation and production 
      methods in the context of probiotics efficacy.

AB  - The human gastrointestinal tract is home to an extremely numerous and diverse 
      collection of microbes, collectively termed the "intestinal microbiota". This 
      microbiota is considered to play a number of key roles in the maintenance of host 
      health, including aiding digestion of otherwise indigestible dietary compounds, 
      synthesis of vitamins and other beneficial metabolites, immune system regulation 
      and enhanced resistance against colonisation by pathogenic microorganisms. 
      Conversely, the intestinal microbiota is also a potent source of antigens and 
      potentially harmful compounds. In health, humans can therefore be considered to 
      exist in a state of natural balance with their microbial inhabitants. A shift in 
      the balance of microbiota composition such that it may become deleterious to host 
      health is termed "dysbiosis". Dysbiosis of the gut microbiota has been implicated 
      in numerous disorders, ranging from intestinal maladies such as inflammatory 
      bowel diseases and colorectal cancer to disorders with more systemic effects such 
      as diabetes, metabolic syndrome and atopy. Given the far reaching influence of 
      the intestinal microbiota on human health a clear future goal must be to develop 
      reliable means to alter the composition of the microbiota and restore a healthy 
      balance of microbial species. While it is clear that much fundamental research 
      remains to be done, potentially important therapeutic options include narrow 
      spectrum antibiotics, novel probiotics, dietary interventions and more radical 
      techniques such as faecal transplantation, all of which aim to suppress clinical 
      dysbiosis, restore intestinal microbiota diversity and improve host health.

TI  - Wheat Bran for Colon Cancer Prevention: The Synergy between Phytochemical 
      Alkylresorcinol C21 and Intestinal Microbial Metabolite Butyrate.
PG  - 12761-12769
LID - 10.1021/acs.jafc.9b05666 [doi]
AB  - There is convincing evidence that consuming whole grains (WGs) may decrease the 
      risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). Wheat bran (WB) is a rich source of dietary 
      fiber and phytochemicals with health-promoting properties. However, the active 
      components especially the interaction between different components in WG wheat 
      have not been fully explored. Here, we investigated whether one of the major WB 
      phytochemicals, alkylresorcinol (AR) C21, and the major active intestinal 
      microbial metabolite of fiber, butyrate, could synergistically suppress human 
      colon cancer cells. Our results demonstrated for the first time that the 
      combination of C21 and butyrate synergistically inhibited the growth of human 
      colon cancer cells and induced apoptosis. Further mechanistic studies 
      demonstrated that the cotreatment of C21 and butyrate induced significant 
      up-regulations in cleaved Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), cleaved caspase 3, 
      p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA), cytochrome C, lipid-conjugated 
      membrane-bound form of microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 
      (LC3-II), and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) expressions, indicating the 
      synergistic anticancer effects of C21 and butyrate were associated with induction 
      of apoptosis, autophagy, and ER stress pathways. Notably, the C21 concentrations 
      in the large intestinal tract of mice treated with human relevant doses of C21, 
      were from 0.86 to 1.78 μmol/g, suggesting the C21 doses used in vitro may be 
      achievable after daily WG wheat intake. These results provide novel insights into 
      the dietary prevention of CRC regarding the potential interaction of bioactive WG 
      wheat phytochemicals and the microbial metabolites of fiber.

PG  - e81352

LID - e81352
AB  - BACKGROUND: Colonic polyps are common tumors occurring in ~50% of Western 
      populations with ~10% risk of malignant progression. Dietary agents have been 
      considered the primary environmental exposure to promote colorectal cancer (CRC) 
      development. However, the colonic mucosa is permanently in contact with the 
      microbiota and its metabolic products including toxins that also have the 
      potential to trigger oncogenic transformation. AIM: To analyze fecal DNA for 
      microbiota composition and functional potential in African Americans with 
      pre-neoplastic lesions. MATERIALS & METHODS: We analyzed the bacterial 
      composition of stool samples from 6 healthy individuals and 6 patients with colon 
      polyps using 16S ribosomal RNA-based phylogenetic microarray; the Human 
      intestinal Tract Chip (HITChip) and 16S rRNA gene barcoded 454 pyrosequencing. 
      The functional potential was determined by sequence-based metagenomics using 454 
      pyrosequencing. RESULTS: Fecal microbiota profiling of samples from the healthy 
      and polyp patients using both a phylogenetic microarraying (HITChip) and barcoded 
      454 pyrosequencing generated similar results. A distinction between both sets of 
      samples was only obtained when the analysis was performed at the sub-genus level. 
      Most of the species leading to the dissociation were from the Bacteroides group. 
      The metagenomic analysis did not reveal major differences in bacterial gene 
      prevalence/abundances between the two groups even when the analysis and 
      comparisons were restricted to available Bacteroides genomes. CONCLUSION: This 
      study reveals that at the pre-neoplastic stages, there is a trend showing 
      microbiota changes between healthy and colon polyp patients at the sub-genus 
      level. These differences were not reflected at the genome/functions levels. 
      Bacteria and associated functions within the Bacteroides group need to be further 
      analyzed and dissected to pinpoint potential actors in the early colon oncogenic 
      transformation in a large sample size.

AB  - In this review, we discuss the multifactorial role of intestinal microbiota in 
      colorectal cancer. The peculiar metabolism of dietary compounds of the individual 
      microbiota complement, its overall immunostimulation and immunomodulatory 
      activity, and eventually the production of toxins that perturb the regulation of 
      cell growth, define the balance of positive and negative risk factors for 
      colorectal cancer development. Moreover, shaping the composition of the human 
      intestinal microbiota, diet has an indirect impact in determining the balance 
      between health and disease. The integration of diet, microbial, and host factors 
      in a system approach is mandatory to determine the overall balance of risk and 
      protective factors for colorectal cancer onset.

AB  - Microbial-triggered inflammation protects against pathogens and yet can 
      paradoxically cause considerable secondary damage to host tissues that can result 
      in tissue fibrosis and carcinogenesis, if persistent. In addition to classical 
      pathogens, gut microbiota bacteria, i.e. a group of mutualistic microorganisms 
      permanently inhabiting the gastrointestinal tract and which plays a key role in 
      digestion, immunity, and cancer prevention, can induce inflammation-associated 
      cancer following the alterations of their microenvironment. Emerging experimental 
      evidence indicates that microbiota members like Escherichia coli and several 
      other genotoxic and mutagenic pathogens can cause DNA damage in various cell 
      types. In addition, the inflammatory response induced by chronic infections with 
      pathogens like the microbiota members Helicobacter spp., which have been 
      associated with liver, colorectal, cervical cancers and lymphoma, for instance, 
      can also trigger carcinogenic processes. A microenvironment including active 
      immune cells releasing high amounts of inflammatory signaling molecules can favor 
      the carcinogenic transformation of host cells. Pivotal molecules released during 
      immune response such as the macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MMIF) and the 
      reactive oxygen and nitrogen species' products superoxide and peroxynitrite, can 
      further damage DNA and cause the accumulation of oncogenic mutations, whereas 
      pro-inflammatory cytokines, adhesion molecules, and growth factors may create a 
      microenvironment promoting neoplastic cell survival and proliferation. Recent 
      findings on the implication of inflammatory signaling pathways in 
      microbial-triggered carcinogenesis as well as the possible role of microbiota 
      modulation in cancer prevention are herein summarized and discussed.

AB  - Multiple factors drive the progression from healthy mucosa towards sporadic 
      colorectal carcinomas and accumulating evidence associates intestinal bacteria 
      with disease initiation and progression. Therefore, the aim of this study was to 
      provide a first high-resolution map of colonic dysbiosis that is associated with 
      human colorectal cancer (CRC). To this purpose, the microbiomes colonizing colon 
      tumor tissue and adjacent non-malignant mucosa were compared by deep rRNA 
      sequencing. The results revealed striking differences in microbial colonization 
      patterns between these two sites. Although inter-individual colonization in CRC 
      patients was variable, tumors consistently formed a niche for Coriobacteria and 
      other proposed probiotic bacterial species, while potentially pathogenic 
      Enterobacteria were underrepresented in tumor tissue. As the intestinal 
      microbiota is generally stable during adult life, these findings suggest that 
      CRC-associated physiological and metabolic changes recruit tumor-foraging 
      commensal-like bacteria. These microbes thus have an apparent competitive 
      advantage in the tumor microenvironment and thereby seem to replace pathogenic 
      bacteria that may be implicated in CRC etiology. This first glimpse of the CRC 
      microbiome provides an important step towards full understanding of the dynamic 
      interplay between intestinal microbial ecology and sporadic CRC, which may 
      provide important leads towards novel microbiome-related diagnostic tools and 
      therapeutic interventions.

AB  - Apart from acute infections, microorganisms may also induce or perpetuate chronic 
      inflammatory diseases and reversible or irreversible proliferation of various 
      cells in the gastrointestinal tract (the extreme being adenocarcinoma and 
      lymphoma). Helicobacter pylori is not only involved in the pathogenesis of 
      lymphoma and gastric adenocarcinoma. The steps and mechanisms of the carcinogenic 
      process involve host predisposition, environmental factors, and strain virulence. 
      The steps of lymphoma genesis include chronic inflammation, acquisition of 
      mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue in the stomach, proliferation of the B 
      lymphocytes in an inflammatory context, acquisition of genetic anomalies and 
      dysregulation of the NF-κB pathway. The role of Campylobacter jejuni in 
      immunoproliferative small bowel disease has also been shown and eradication of 
      this bacterium can cure the lymphoma at its early stage. The evidence for the 
      role of some bacteria in colon cancer development is discussed. Opportunistic 
      pathogens are detected in the stools or mucosa of a proportion of subjects with 
      Crohn's disease. They include Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis, adherent 
      invasive Escherichia coli, and Clostridium difficile. A dysbiosis has been 
      repeatedly observed in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Instability of 
      the dominant microbiota and decreased biodiversity (especially in the firmicutes 
      phylum) are major characteristics. The decrease of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii 
      seems to have a prognostic value to predict relapse of Crohn's disease after 
      surgery. Finally, important perspectives are opened by new tools such as 
      metagenomics and metabolomics of the gastrointestinal ecosystems. Major tracks 
      concern irritable bowel syndrome, colon cancer and obesity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Prediabetes is an intermediate metabolic state between normoglycemia 
      and diabetes. Without intervention, prediabetes often progresses to diabetes and 
      prediabetes is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer, 
      renal disease, and dementia. Lifestyle modification play a major role in 
      controlling prediabetes. But lifestyle interventions are often with poor 
      compliance and side effects of drugs are often be dislike by people. As a 
      non-invasive therapy with no side effects, abdominal massage (AM), also called 
      viscera massage in China, has been used to treat prediabetes and 
      obesity-associated diseases. The gut microbiota has been recognized as an 
      important factor in the development of metabolic diseases. Individuals with 
      prediabetes have aberrant intestinal microbiota character. Colonic transport time 
      and stool consistency are strongly associated with gut microbiota. Viscera 
      massage can ease constipation by reducing colonic transport time and promoting 
      intestinal motility. We can infer that viscera massage can modulate composition 
      of gut microbiota affects human metabolism. So, in this trial, we will explore 
      the mechanism of viscera massage on prediabetes from the perspective of 
      intestinal microbiota. METHODS AND DESIGN: Eighty prediabetes individuals will be 
      recruited for this study. Eighty prediabetes individuals will be divided into 
      lifestyle intervention group and viscera massage + lifestyle intervention group 
      by a simple random method. Each group will have 40 individuals. The manipulation 
      of the viscera massage + lifestyle intervention group will be mainly carried out 
      through rubbing the abdomen, kneading abdomen, vibrating abdomen, and pressing 
      the abdomen, 30 minutes per time, once a day, with 2 days off every 5 days. 
      Lifestyle interventions will be performed by combining pushing healthy lifestyle 
      guidance information through Wechat application and giving face-to-face advice 
      together daily. The lifestyle intervention group will receive healthy lifestyle 
      intervention only. All the intervention will be conducted for 4 weeks. Weight, 
      body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, and 
      waist-to-height ratio will be measured at the last day of every week. 
      Triglycerides, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 
      high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, fasting blood-glucose, 2-hour post-meal 
      blood glucose (2hPG) and glycosylated hemoglobin, fasting insulin and insulin 
      resistance index will be tested at the first day and last day of the intervention 
      course. The fecal samples of subjects will be gathered at the first day and last 
      day of the intervention course and will be performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing and 
      metagenomic detection. Finally, the effect and potential mechanism of viscera 
      massage on prediabetes will be discussed in combination with all the results. 
      DISCUSSION: The results of this study will be used to verify the effect of AM on 
      prediabetes and explore the mechanism of AM on prediabetes from the perspective 
      of gut microbiota.

TI  - MAP9 Loss Triggers Chromosomal Instability, Initiates Colorectal Tumorigenesis, 
      and Is Associated with Poor Survival of Patients with Colorectal Cancer.
PG  - 746-757
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-19-1611 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Chromosomal instability (CIN) is a common phenomenon in colorectal 
      cancer, but its role and underlying cause remain unknown. We have identified that 
      mitotic regulator microtubule-associated protein 9 (MAP9) is a critical regulator 
      of CIN in colorectal cancer. We thus studied the effect of MAP9 loss on 
      colorectal cancer in Map9-knockout mice and in cell lines. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: 
      We generated colon epithelial-specific Map9-knockout mice and evaluated 
      colorectal cancer development. Effect of Map9 knockout on colorectal cancer 
      progression was determined in chemical or Apc(Min) (/+) -induced colorectal 
      cancer. Molecular mechanism of MAP9 was determined using spectral karyotyping, 
      microtubule assays, and whole-genome sequencing (WGS). Clinical significance of 
      MAP9 was examined in 141 patients with CRC. RESULTS: Spontaneous colonic tumors 
      (9.1%) were developed in colon epithelium-specific Map9-knockout mice at 17 
      months, but none was observed in wild-type littermates. Map9 deletion accelerated 
      colorectal cancer formation both in Apc(Min) (/+) mice and azoxymethane-treated 
      mice, and reduced survival in Apc(Min) (/+) mice. Mechanistically, MAP9 
      stabilized microtubules and mediated mitotic spindle assembly. MAP9 also 
      maintained the spindle pole integrity and protected K-fiber from depolymerization 
      at spindle poles. MAP9 loss induced severe mitosis failure, chromosome 
      segregation errors, and aneuploidy, leading to transformation of normal colon 
      epithelial cells. WGS confirmed enhanced CIN in intestinal tumors from Map9 
      knockout Apc(Min) (/+) mice. In patients with colorectal cancer, MAP9 was 
      frequently silenced and its downregulation was associated with poor survival. 
      CONCLUSIONS: MAP9 is a microtubule stabilizer that contributes to spindle 
      stability and inhibits colorectal tumorigenesis, supporting the role of MAP9 as a 
      tumor suppressor for preventing CIN in colorectal cancer.

AB  - Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are considered to be responsible for tumorigenesis and 
      cancer relapse. EpCAM(high)CD44(+) tumor cells are putative colorectal CSCs that 
      express high levels of stem cell genes, while the EpCAM(high)CD44(-) population 
      mostly contains differentiated tumor cells (DTCs). This study aims to determine 
      whether single CSC (EpCAM(high)CD44(+)) and DTC (EpCAM(high)CD44(-)) can be 
      distinguished in terms of somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs). We applied 
      fluorescence-activated cell sorting to isolate the CD45(-)EpCAM(high)CD44(+) and 
      CD45(-)EpCAM(high)CD44(-) populations from two primary colon tumors, on which 
      low-coverage single-cell whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was then performed ∼0.1x 
      depth. We compared the SCNAs of the CSCs and DTCs at single-cell resolution. In 
      total, 47 qualified single cells of the two populations underwent WGS. The 
      single-cell SCNA profiles showed that there were obvious SCNAs in both the CSCs 
      and DTCs of each patient, and each patient had a specific copy number alteration 
      pattern. Hierarchical clustering and correlation analysis both showed that the 
      SCNA profiles of CSCs and DTCs from the same patient had similar SCNA pattern, 
      while there were regional differences in the CSCs and DTCs in certain patient. 
      SCNAs of CSCs in the same patient were highly reproducible. Our data suggest that 
      major SCNAs occurred at an early stage and were inherited steadily. The 
      similarity of ubiquitous SCNAs between the CSCs and DTCs might have arisen from 
      lineage differentiation. CSCs from the same patient had reproducible SCNA 
      profiles, indicating that gain or loss in certain chromosome is required for 
      colon cancer development.

AB  - Accumulating evidence indicates that the gut microbiome and metabolites are 
      associated with colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the influence of surgery for 
      CRC treatment on the gut microbiome and metabolites and how it relates to CRC 
      risk in postoperative CRC patients remain partially understood. Here, we 
      collected 170 fecal samples from 85 CRC patients pre- and approximately 1 year 
      postsurgery and performed shotgun metagenomic sequencing and capillary 
      electrophoresis-time of flight mass spectrometry-based metabolomics analyses to 
      characterize alterations between pre- and postsurgery. We determined that the 
      relative abundance of 114 species was altered postsurgery (P < 0.005). 
      CRC-associated species, such as Fusobacterium nucleatum, were decreased 
      postsurgery. On the other hand, Clostridium scindens, carcinogenesis-associated 
      deoxycholate (DCA)-producing species, and its biotransformed genes (bai operon) 
      were increased postsurgery. The concentration of 60 fecal metabolites was also 
      altered postsurgery (P < 0.005). Two bile acids, cholate and DCA, were increased 
      postsurgery. We developed methods to estimate postoperative CRC risk based on the 
      gut microbiome and metabolomic compositions using a random forest 
      machine-learning algorithm that classifies large adenoma or early-stage CRC and 
      healthy controls from publicly available data sets. We applied methods to 
      preoperative samples and then compared the estimated CRC risk between the two 
      groups according to the presence of large adenoma or tumors 5 years postsurgery 
      (P < 0.05). Overall, our results show that the gut microbiome and metabolites 
      dynamically change from pre- to postsurgery. In postoperative CRC patients, 
      potential CRC risk derived from gut microbiome and metabolites still remains, 
      which indicates the importance of follow-up assessments. IMPORTANCE The gut 
      microbiome and metabolites are associated with CRC progression and 
      carcinogenesis. Postoperative CRC patients are reported to be at an increased CRC 
      risk; however, how gut microbiome and metabolites are related to CRC risk in 
      postoperative patients remains only partially understood. In this study, we 
      investigated the influence of surgical CRC treatment on the gut microbiome and 
      metabolites. We found that the CRC-associated species Fusobacterium nucleatum was 
      decreased postsurgery, whereas carcinogenesis-associated DCA and its producing 
      species and genes were increased postsurgery. We developed methods to estimate 
      postoperative CRC risk based on the gut microbiome and metabolomic compositions. 
      We applied methods to compare the estimated CRC risk between two groups according 
      to the presence of large adenoma or tumors after 5 years postsurgery. To our 
      knowledge, this study is the first report on differences between pre- and 
      postsurgery using metagenomics and metabolomics data analysis. Our methods might 
      be used for CRC risk assessment in postoperative patients.

AB  - Although colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of death in Morocco, there 
      are no studies of the microbiome changes associated with the disease in the 
      Moroccan population. The aim of our study was to compare the stool microbiome of 
      Moroccan cancer patients with healthy individuals. We analyzed the microbiome 
      composition of samples from 11 CRC patients and 12 healthy individuals by 16S 
      rRNA amplicon sequencing. Principal coordinate analysis of samples revealed 
      defined cancer versus healthy clusters. Our findings showed that cancer samples 
      had higher proportions of Firmicutes (T = 50.5%; N = 28.4%; p = 0.04), 
      specifically of Clostridia (T = 48.3%; N = 19.0%; p = 0.002), and Fusobacteria 
      (T = 0.1%; N = 0.0%; p = 0.02), especially of Fusobacteriia (T = 0.1%; N = 0.0%; 
      p = 0.02), while Bacteroidetes were enriched in healthy samples (T = 35.1%; 
      N = 62.8%; p = 0.06), particularly the class Bacteroidia (T = 35.1%; N = 62.6%; 
      p = 0.06). Porphyromonas, Clostridium, Ruminococcus, Selenomonas, and 
      Fusobacterium were significantly overrepresented in diseased patients, similarly 
      to other studies. Predicted functional information showed that bacterial motility 
      proteins, flagellar assembly, and fatty acid biosynthesis metabolism were 
      significantly overrepresented in cancer patients, while amino acid metabolism and 
      glycan biosynthesis were overrepresented in controls. This suggests that 
      involvement of these functional metagenomes is similar and relevant in the 
      carcinogenesis process, independent of the origin of the samples. Results from 
      this study allowed identification of bacterial taxa relevant to the Moroccan 
      population and encourages larger studies to facilitate population-directed 
      therapeutic approaches.

TI  - Metagenomic analysis of the human microbiome reveals the association between the 
      abundance of gut bile salt hydrolases and host health.
PG  - 1300-1313
LID - 10.1080/19490976.2020.1748261 [doi]
AB  - Bile acid metabolism by the gut microbiome exerts both beneficial and harmful 
      effects on host health. Microbial bile salt hydrolases (BSHs), which initiate 
      bile acid metabolism, exhibit both positive and negative effects on host 
      physiology. In this study, 5,790 BSH homologs were collected and classified into 
      seven clusters based on a sequence similarity network. Next, the abundance and 
      distribution of BSH in 380 metagenomes from healthy participants were analyzed. 
      It was observed that different clusters occupied diverse ecological niches in the 
      human microbiome and that the clusters with signal peptides were relatively 
      abundant in the gut. Then, the association between BSH clusters and 12 human 
      diseases was analyzed by comparing the abundances of BSH genes in patients (n 
      = 1,605) and healthy controls (n = 1,540). The analysis identified a significant 
      association between BSH gene abundance and 10 human diseases, including 
      gastrointestinal diseases, obesity, type 2 diabetes, liver diseases, 
      cardiovascular diseases, and neurological diseases. The associations were further 
      validated by separate cohorts with inflammatory bowel diseases and colorectal 
      cancer. These large-scale studies of enzyme sequences combined with metagenomic 
      data provide a reproducible assessment of the association between gut BSHs and 
      human diseases. This information can contribute to future diagnostic and 
      therapeutic applications of BSH-active bacteria for improving human health.

AB  - Gut microbiome studies have been gaining popularity over the years, especially 
      with the development of new technologies (e.g. metataxonomics, metagenomics, 
      metatranscriptomics, and metabonomics) that makes it easier for researchers to 
      characterize the composition and functionality of these complex microbial 
      communities. The goal of these studies is to identify a microorganism, group of 
      microbes, or microbial metabolite which correlates with a disease state (e.g. 
      inflammatory bowel disease, colorectal cancer, and obesity). Many of these are 
      cross-sectional studies, where fecal samples from a group of diseased individuals 
      are compared with those from a group of healthy individuals at a single time 
      point. However, there are a wide range of variables that can affect the gut 
      microbiota of humans which make mechanistic studies challenging. Longitudinal 
      studies are required for research to more reliably correlate interventions or 
      disease status to microbiota composition and functionality. However, longitudinal 
      studies in humans and animals are difficult, expensive, and time-consuming. This 
      review will discuss in vitro gut fermentation models and how they can be used to 
      perform longitudinal studies that complement in vivo microbiome studies. Gut 
      fermentation models support the growth of stable, reproducible, and diverse 
      microbial communities in a tightly controlled environment set to mimic the 
      conditions microbes encounter in the gastrointestinal tract. Gut fermentation 
      models will make it easier for researchers to perform mechanistic studies and aid 
      in the development of novel treatments that are both targeted and maintained over 
      time.

AB  - Methanogens are the archaea most commonly found in humans, in particular in the 
      digestive tract and are an integral part of the digestive microbiota. They are 
      present in humans from the earliest moments of life and represent the only known 
      source of methane production to date. They are notably detected in humans by 
      microscopy, fluorescent in situ hybridization, molecular biology including 
      PCR-sequencing, metagenomics, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization 
      time-of-flight mass spectrometry and culture. Methanogens present in the human 
      digestive tract play major roles, in particular the use of hydrogen from the 
      fermentation products of bacteria, thus promoting digestion. They are also 
      involved in the transformation of heavy metals and in the use of trimethylamine 
      produced by intestinal bacteria, thus preventing major health problems, in 
      particular cardiovascular diseases. Several pieces of evidence suggest their 
      close physical contacts with bacteria support symbiotic metabolism. Their 
      imbalance during dysbiosis is associated with many pathologies in humans, 
      particularly digestive tract diseases such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative 
      colitis, diverticulosis, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, 
      colonic polyposis, and colorectal cancer. There is a huge deficit of knowledge 
      and partially contradictory information concerning human methanogens, so much 
      remains to be done to fully understand their physiological role in humans. It is 
      necessary to develop new methods for the identification and culture of 
      methanogens from clinical samples. This will permit to isolate new methanogens 
      species as well as their phenotypic characterization, to explore their genome by 
      sequencing and to study the population dynamics of methanogens by specifying in 
      particular their exact role within the complex flora associated with the mucous 
      microbiota of human.

TI  - Mutagenicity of acrylamide and glycidamide in human TP53 knock-in (Hupki) mouse 
      embryo fibroblasts.
PG  - 4173-4196
LID - 10.1007/s00204-020-02878-0 [doi]
AB  - Acrylamide is a suspected human carcinogen formed during high-temperature cooking 
      of starch-rich foods. It is metabolised by cytochrome P450 2E1 to its reactive 
      metabolite glycidamide, which forms pre-mutagenic DNA adducts. Using the human 
      TP53 knock-in (Hupki) mouse embryo fibroblasts (HUFs) immortalisation assay 
      (HIMA), acrylamide- and glycidamide-induced mutagenesis was studied in the tumour 
      suppressor gene TP53. Selected immortalised HUF clones were also subjected to 
      next-generation sequencing to determine mutations across the whole genome. The 
      TP53-mutant frequency after glycidamide exposure (1.1 mM for 24 h, n = 198) was 
      9% compared with 0% in cultures treated with acrylamide [1.5 (n = 24) or 3 mM 
      (n = 6) for 48 h] and untreated vehicle (water) controls (n = 36). Most 
      glycidamide-induced mutations occurred at adenines with A > T/T > A and 
      A > G/T > C mutations being the most common types. Mutations induced by 
      glycidamide occurred at specific TP53 codons that have also been found to be 
      mutated in human tumours (i.e., breast, ovary, colorectal, and lung) previously 
      associated with acrylamide exposure. The spectrum of TP53 mutations was further 
      reflected by the mutations detected by whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and a 
      distinct WGS mutational signature was found in HUF clones treated with 
      glycidamide that was again characterised by A > G/T > C and A > T/T > A 
      mutations. The WGS mutational signature showed similarities with COSMIC 
      mutational signatures SBS3 and 25 previously found in human tumours (e.g., breast 
      and ovary), while the adenine component was similar to COSMIC SBS4 found mostly 
      in smokers' lung cancer. In contrast, in acrylamide-treated HUF clones, only 
      culture-related background WGS mutational signatures were observed. In summary, 
      the results of the present study suggest that glycidamide may be involved in the 
      development of breast, ovarian, and lung cancer.

TI  - Antitumor Necrosis Factor-like Ligand 1A Therapy Targets Tissue Inflammation and 
      Fibrosis Pathways and Reduces Gut Pathobionts in Ulcerative Colitis.
PG  - 434-446
LID - 10.1093/ibd/izab193 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The first-in-class treatment PF-06480605 targets the tumor necrosis 
      factor-like ligand 1A (TL1A) molecule in humans. Results from the phase 2a 
      TUSCANY trial highlighted the safety and efficacy of PF-06480605 in ulcerative 
      colitis. Preclinical and in vitro models have identified a role for TL1A in both 
      innate and adaptive immune responses, but the mechanisms underlying the efficacy 
      of anti-TL1A treatment in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are not known. 
      METHODS: Here, we provide analysis of tissue transcriptomic, peripheral blood 
      proteomic, and fecal metagenomic data from the recently completed phase 2a 
      TUSCANY trial and demonstrate endoscopic improvement post-treatment with 
      PF-06480605 in participants with ulcerative colitis. RESULTS: Our results 
      revealed robust TL1A target engagement in colonic tissue and a distinct colonic 
      transcriptional response reflecting a reduction in inflammatory T helper 17 cell, 
      macrophage, and fibrosis pathways in patients with endoscopic improvement. 
      Proteomic analysis of peripheral blood revealed a corresponding decrease in 
      inflammatory T-cell cytokines. Finally, microbiome analysis showed significant 
      changes in IBD-associated pathobionts, Streptococcus salivarius, S. 
      parasanguinis, and Haemophilus parainfluenzae post-therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      ability of PF-06480605 to engage and inhibit colonic TL1A, targeting inflammatory 
      T cell and fibrosis pathways, provides the first-in-human mechanistic data to 
      guide anti-TL1A therapy for the treatment of IBD.

TI  - Metagenomic Analysis of Common Intestinal Diseases Reveals Relationships among 
      Microbial Signatures and Powers Multidisease Diagnostic Models.

AB  - Common intestinal diseases such as Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), 
      and colorectal cancer (CRC) share clinical symptoms and altered gut microbes, 
      necessitating cross-disease comparisons and the use of multidisease models. Here, 
      we performed meta-analyses on 13 fecal metagenome data sets of the three 
      diseases. We identified 87 species and 65 pathway markers that were consistently 
      changed in multiple data sets of the same diseases. According to their overall 
      trends, we grouped the disease-enriched marker species into disease-specific and 
      disease-common clusters and revealed their distinct phylogenetic relationships; 
      species in the CD-specific cluster were phylogenetically related, while those in 
      the CRC-specific cluster were more distant. Strikingly, UC-specific species were 
      phylogenetically closer to CRC, likely because UC patients have higher risk of 
      CRC. Consistent with their phylogenetic relationships, marker species had similar 
      within-cluster and different between-cluster metabolic preferences. A portion of 
      marker species and pathways correlated with an indicator of leaky gut, suggesting 
      a link between gut dysbiosis and human-derived contents. Marker species showed 
      more coordinated changes and tighter inner-connections in cases than the 
      controls, suggesting that the diseased gut may represent a stressed environment 
      and pose stronger selection on gut microbes. With the marker species and 
      pathways, we constructed four high-performance (including multidisease) models 
      with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.87 
      and true-positive rates up to 90%, and explained their putative clinical 
      applications. We identified consistent microbial alterations in common intestinal 
      diseases, revealed metabolic capacities and the relationships among marker 
      bacteria in distinct states, and supported the feasibility of metagenome-derived 
      multidisease diagnosis.IMPORTANCE Gut microbes have been identified as potential 
      markers in distinguishing patients from controls in colorectal cancer, ulcerative 
      colitis, and Crohn's disease individually, whereas there lacks a systematic 
      analysis to investigate the exclusive microbial shifts of these enteropathies 
      with similar clinical symptoms. Our meta-analysis and cross-disease comparisons 
      identified consistent microbial alterations in each enteropathy, revealed 
      microbial ecosystems among marker bacteria in distinct states, and demonstrated 
      the necessity and feasibility of metagenome-based multidisease classifications. 
      To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to construct multiclass 
      models for these common intestinal diseases.

      Assay to Measure Tumour Mutational Burden and Detect Clinically Actionable 
      Variants.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The identification of tumour mutational burden (TMB) as a biomarker 
      of response to programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) immunotherapy has 
      necessitated the development of genomic assays to measure this. We carried out 
      comprehensive molecular profiling of cancers using the Illumina TruSight Oncology 
      500 (TSO500) panel and compared these to whole-genome sequencing (WGS). METHODS: 
      Cancer samples derived from formalin-fixed material were profiled on the TSO500 
      panel, sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 instrument and processed through the 
      TSO500 Docker pipeline. Either FASTQ files (PierianDx) or vcf files (OncoKDM) 
      were processed to understand clinical actionability. RESULTS: In total, 108 
      samples (a mixture of colorectal, lung, oesophageal and control samples) were 
      processed via the DNA panel. There was good correlation between TMB, 
      single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), indels and copy-number variations as predicted 
      by TSO500 and WGS (R(2) > 0.9) and good reproducibility, with less than 5% 
      variability between repeated controls. For the RNA panel, 13 samples were 
      processed, with all known fusions observed via orthogonal techniques. For 
      clinical actionability, 72 tier 1 variants and 297 tier 2 variants were detected, 
      with clinical trials identified for all patients. CONCLUSIONS: The TSO500 assay 
      accurately measures TMB, microsatellite instability, SNVs, indels, 
      copy-number/structural variation and gene fusions when compared to WGS and 
      orthogonal technologies. Coupled with a clinical annotation pipeline, this 
      provides a powerful methodology for identification of clinically actionable 
      variants.

TI  - Metagenomic Analyses Expand Bacterial and Functional Profiling Biomarkers for 
      Colorectal Cancer in a Hainan Cohort, China.

AB  - This study was conducted for the metagenomic analysis of stool samples from CRC 
      affected individuals to identify biomarkers for CRC in Hainan, the only tropical 
      island province of China. The gut microbiota of CRC patients differed 
      significantly from that of healthy and reference database cohorts based on 
      Aitchison distance and Bray-Cutis distance but there was no significant 
      difference in alpha diversity. Furthermore, at the species level, 68 species were 
      significantly altered including 37 CRC-enriched, such as, Fusobacterium 
      nucleatum, Parvimonas micra, Gemella morbillorum, Citrobacter portucalensis, 
      Alloprevotella sp., Shigella sonnei, Coriobacteriaceae bacterium, etc. 
      Sixty-seven different metabolic pathways were acquired, and pathways involved in 
      the synthesis of many amino acids were significantly declined. Besides, 2 
      identified antibiotic resistance genes performed well (area under the 
      receive-operation curve AUC = 0.833, 95% CI 58.51-100%) compared with virulence 
      factor genes. The results of the present study provide region-specific bacterial 
      and functional biomarkers of gut microbiota for CRC patients in Hainan. 
      Microbiota is considered as a non-invasive biomarker for the detection of CRC. 
      Gut microbiota of different geographic regions should be further studied to 
      expand the understanding of markers, especially for the China cohort due to 
      diverse nationalities and lifestyles.

TI  - Community and shotgun metagenomic analysis of Alligator mississippiensis oral

      antibiotic resistance.

AB  - We report here the community structure and functional analysis of the microbiome 
      of the Alligator mississippiensis GI tract from the oral cavity through the 
      entirety of the digestive tract. Although many vertebrate microbiomes have been 
      studied in recent years, the archosaur microbiome has only been given cursory 
      attention. In the oral cavity we used amplicon-based community analysis to 
      examine the structure of the oral microbiome during alligator development. We 
      found a community that diversified over time and showed many of the hallmarks we 
      would expect of a stable oral community. This is a bit surprising given the rapid 
      turnover of alligator teeth but suggests that the stable gumline microbes are 
      able to rapidly colonize the emerging teeth. As we move down the digestive tract, 
      we were able to use both long and short read sequencing approaches to evaluate 
      the community using a shotgun metagenomics approach. Long read sequencing was 
      applied to samples from the stomach/duodenum, and the colorectal region, 
      revealing a fairly uniform and low complexity community made up primarily of 
      proteobacteria at the top of the gut and much more diversity in the colon. We 
      used deep short read sequencing to further interrogate this colorectal community. 
      The two sequencing approaches were concordant with respect to community structure 
      but substantially more detail was available in the short read data, in spite of 
      high levels of host DNA contamination. Using both approaches we were able to show 
      that the colorectal community is a potential reservoir for antibiotic resistance, 
      human pathogens such as Clostridiodes difficile and a possible source of novel 
      antimicrobials or other useful secondary metabolites.

AB  - The gut microbiota is a highly diverse and relative stabile ecosystem 
      increasingly recognized for its impact on human health. The homeostasis of 
      microbes and the host is also referred to as eubiosis. In contrast, deviation 
      from the normal composition, defined as dysbiosis, is often associated with 
      localized diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease or colonic cancer, but also 
      with systemic diseases like metabolic syndrome and allergic diseases. Modulating 
      a gut microbiota dysbiosis with nutritional concepts may contribute to improving 
      health status, reducing diseases or disease symptoms or supporting already 
      established treatments. The gut microbiota can be modulated by different 
      nutritional concepts, varying from specific food ingredients to complex diets or 
      by the ingestion of particular live microorganisms. To underpin the importance of 
      bacteria in the gut, we describe molecular mechanisms involved in the crosstalk 
      between gut bacteria and the human host, and review the impact of different 
      nutritional concepts such as pre-, pro- and synbiotics on the gastrointestinal 
      ecosystem and their potential health benefits. The aim of this review is to 
      provide examples of potential nutritional concepts that target the gut microbiota 
      to support human physiology and potentially health outcomes.

AB  - Available evidence on the bioactive, nutritional and putative detrimental 
      properties of gut microbial metabolites has been evaluated to support a more 
      integrated view of how prebiotics might affect host health throughout life. The 
      present literature inventory targeted evidence for the physiological and 
      nutritional effects of metabolites, for example, SCFA, the potential toxicity of 
      other metabolites and attempted to determine normal concentration ranges. 
      Furthermore, the biological relevance of more holistic approaches like faecal 
      water toxicity assays and metabolomics and the limitations of faecal measurements 
      were addressed. Existing literature indicates that protein fermentation 
      metabolites (phenol, p-cresol, indole, ammonia), typically considered as 
      potentially harmful, occur at concentration ranges in the colon such that no 
      toxic effects are expected either locally or following systemic absorption. The 
      endproducts of saccharolytic fermentation, SCFA, may have effects on colonic 
      health, host physiology, immunity, lipid and protein metabolism and appetite 
      control. However, measuring SCFA concentrations in faeces is insufficient to 
      assess the dynamic processes of their nutrikinetics. Existing literature on the 
      usefulness of faecal water toxicity measures as indicators of cancer risk seems 
      limited. In conclusion, at present there is insufficient evidence to use changes 
      in faecal bacterial metabolite concentrations as markers of prebiotic 
      effectiveness. Integration of results from metabolomics and metagenomics holds 
      promise for understanding the health implications of prebiotic microbiome 
      modulation but adequate tools for data integration and interpretation are 
      currently lacking. Similarly, studies measuring metabolite fluxes in different 
      body compartments to provide a more accurate picture of their nutrikinetics are 
      needed.

TI  - Relationships of Gut Microbiota Composition, Short-Chain Fatty Acids and 
      Polyamines with the Pathological Response to Neoadjuvant Radiochemotherapy in 
      Colorectal Cancer Patients.
LID - 10.3390/ijms22179549 [doi]

AB  - Emerging evidence has suggested that dysbiosis of the gut microbiota may 
      influence the drug efficacy of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients during cancer 
      treatment by modulating drug metabolism and the host immune response. Moreover, 
      gut microbiota can produce metabolites that may influence tumor proliferation and 
      therapy responsiveness. In this study we have investigated the potential 
      contribution of the gut microbiota and microbial-derived metabolites such as 
      short chain fatty acids and polyamines to neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy (RCT) 
      outcome in CRC patients. First, we established a profile for healthy gut 
      microbiota by comparing the microbial diversity and composition between CRC 
      patients and healthy controls. Second, our metagenomic analysis revealed that the 
      gut microbiota composition of CRC patients was relatively stable over treatment 
      time with neoadjuvant RCT. Nevertheless, treated patients who achieved clinical 
      benefits from RTC (responders, R) had significantly higher microbial diversity 
      and richness compared to non-responder patients (NR). Importantly, the fecal 
      microbiota of the R was enriched in butyrate-producing bacteria and had 
      significantly higher levels of acetic, butyric, isobutyric, and hexanoic acids 
      than NR. In addition, NR patients exhibited higher serum levels of spermine and 
      acetyl polyamines (oncometabolites related to CRC) as well as zonulin (gut 
      permeability marker), and their gut microbiota was abundant in pro-inflammatory 
      species. Finally, we identified a baseline consortium of five bacterial species 
      that could potentially predict CRC treatment outcome. Overall, our results 
      suggest that the gut microbiota may have an important role in the response to 
      cancer therapies in CRC patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: FOLFOX treatment is a method used widely to reduce tumor size in 
      low-set rectal cancer, with variable clinical results. FOLFOX agents comprise a 
      mixture of oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil, the efficacy of which might be 
      modulated by the gut microbiome in humans. This study aimed to determine whether 
      the bowel microbiota is a factor that influences FOLFOX treatment. METHODS: To 
      investigate the role of gut microbiota during FOLFOX treatment, we carried out 
      comprehensive metagenomic and metabolomic analyses on 62 fecal samples collected 
      from 37 low-set rectal cancer patients. A set of 31 samples was collected before 
      the patients underwent treatment; another 31 samples were obtained after the 
      treatment was completed. Among these samples, 50 were paired samples collected 
      before and after FOLFOX treatment. The patients were divided into responder and 
      nonresponder groups according to the treatment outcome. Metagenomic sequencing 
      was performed on these fecal samples. Diverse bacterial taxa were identified by 
      MetaGeneMark, Soapaligner, and DIAMOND; microbiotal data analyses were carried 
      out in the R environment. Differences in microbial taxa and metagenomic linkage 
      groups were observed in multiple comparative analyses. RESULTS: The gut 
      microbiota was altered after treatment. Compared with before treatment, the 
      changes in bacterial diversity and microbiotal composition after treatment were 
      more apparent in the responder group than in the nonresponder group. Bacterial 
      species analysis revealed a group of gut bacteria in multiple comparisons, with a 
      group of eight specific species being associated with the outcome of FOLFOX 
      treatment. Responders and nonresponders before treatment were clearly separated 
      based on this bacterial subset. Finally, the metagenomic linkage group network 
      and metabolomic analyses based on the genomic data confirmed a more significant 
      change in the gut microbiota during FOLFOX treatment in the responder group than 
      in the nonresponder group. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our results describe a dynamic 
      process of gut microbiotal changes from the start to the end of FOLFOX treatment, 
      and verified a close relationship between microbiota and treatment outcome. 
      Recognition of the significance of microbiotal intervention before FOLFOX 
      treatment for low-set rectal cancer may improve the effects of these agents.

AB  - The involvement of gut microbiota in T-cell trafficking into tumor tissue of 
      colorectal cancer (CRC) remains to be further elucidated. The current study aimed 
      to evaluate the expression of major cytotoxic T-cell trafficking chemokines 
      (CTTCs) and chemokine-associated microbiota profiles in both tumor and adjacent 
      normal tissues during CRC progression. We analyzed the expression of chemokine 
      C-X-C motif ligands 9, 10, and 11 (CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11), and C-C motif 
      ligand 5 (CCL5), characterized gut mucosa-associated microbiota (MAM), and 
      investigated their correlations in CRC patients. Our results showed that the 
      expression of CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 was significantly higher in tumor than in 
      adjacent normal tissues in 136 CRC patients. Notably, the high expression of 
      CXCL9 in tumor tissues was associated with enhanced CD8(+) T-cell infiltration 
      and improved survival. Moreover, the MAM in tumor tissues showed reduction of 
      microbial diversity and increase of oral bacteria. Microbial network analysis 
      identified differences in microbial composition and structure between tumor and 
      adjacent normal tissues. In addition, stronger associations between oral bacteria 
      and other gut microbes were observed. Furthermore, the correlation analysis 
      between the defined MAM and individual CTTCs showed that the CTTCs' correlated 
      operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in tumor and adjacent normal tissues rarely 
      overlap with each other. Notably, all the enriched OTUs were positively 
      correlated with the CTTCs in either tumor or adjacent normal tissues. Our 
      findings demonstrated stronger interactions between oral bacteria and gut 
      microbes, and a shifted correlation pattern between MAM and major CTTCs in tumor 
      tissues, underlining possible mechanisms of gut microbiota-host interaction in 
      CRC.

AB  - AIM: To investigate differences in microbes and short chain fatty acid (SCFA) 
      levels in stool samples from Hispanic and non-Hispanic African American, American 
      Indian, and White participants. METHODS: Stool samples from twenty participants 
      were subjected to analysis for relative levels of viable bacteria and for SCFA 
      levels. Additionally, the samples were subjected to 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing 
      for identification of bacteria present in the stool. We used a metagenome 
      functional prediction technique to analyze genome copy numbers and estimate the 
      abundance of butyrate kinase in all samples. RESULTS: We found that African 
      Americans had significantly lower levels of acetate, butyrate, and total SCFAs 
      than all other racial/ethnic groups. We also found that participant microbial 
      profiles differed by racial/ethnic group. African Americans had significantly 
      more Firmicutes than Whites, with enriched Ruminococcaceae. The 
      Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio was also significantly higher for African 
      Americans than for Whites (P = 0.049). We found Clostridium levels to be 
      significantly and inversely related to total SCFA levels (P = 0.019) and we found 
      Bacteroides to be positively associated (P = 0.027) and Clostridium to be 
      negatively associated (P = 0.012) with levels of butyrate. We also identified a 
      correlation between copy number for a butyrate kinase predicted from 16S rRNA 
      gene abundance and levels of butyrate in stool. CONCLUSION: The identified 
      differences in gut flora and SCFA levels may relate to colorectal cancer 
      mortality differentials and may be useful as targets for future clinical and 
      behavioral interventions.

TI  - Mutagenicity of 2-hydroxyamino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine

AB  - 2-Amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) is a possible human 
      carcinogen formed in cooked fish and meat. PhIP is bioactivated by cytochrome 
      P450 enzymes to form 2-hydroxyamino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine 
      (N-OH-PhIP), a genotoxic metabolite that reacts with DNA leading to the 
      mutation-prone DNA adduct N-(deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-PhIP (dG-C8-PhIP). Here, we 
      studied N-OH-PhIP-induced whole genome mutagenesis in human TP53 knock-in (Hupki) 
      mouse embryo fibroblasts (HUFs) immortalised and subjected to whole genome 
      sequencing (WGS). In addition, mutagenicity of N-OH-PhIP in TP53 and the lacZ 
      reporter gene were assessed. TP53 mutant frequency in HUF cultures treated with 
      N-OH-PhIP (2.5 μM for 24 h, n = 90) was 10% while no TP53 mutations were found in 
      untreated controls (DMSO for 24 h, n = 6). All N-OH-PhIP-induced TP53 mutations 
      occurred at G:C base pairs with G > T/C > A transversions accounting for 58% of 
      them. TP53 mutations characteristic of those induced by N-OH-PhIP have been found 
      in human tumours including breast and colorectal, which are cancer types that 
      have been associated with PhIP exposure. LacZ mutant frequency increased 25-fold 
      at 5 μM N-OH-PHIP and up to ~350 dG-C8-PhIP adducts/10(8) nucleosides were 
      detected by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionisation 
      multistage scan mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-MS(3)) at this concentration. In 
      addition, a WGS mutational signature defined by G > T/C > A transversions was 
      present in N-OH-PhIP-treated immortalised clones, which showed similarity to 
      COSMIC SBS4, 18 and 29 signatures found in human tumours.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a multifactorial disease resulting from 
      both genetic predisposition and environmental factors including the gut 
      microbiota (GM), but deciphering the influence of genetic variants, environmental 
      variables, and interactions with the GM is exceedingly difficult. We previously 
      observed significant differences in intestinal adenoma multiplicity between 
      C57BL/6 J-Apc(Min) (B6-Min/J) from The Jackson Laboratory (JAX), and original 
      founder strain C57BL/6JD-Apc(Min) (B6-Min/D) from the University of Wisconsin. 
      METHODS: To resolve genetic and environmental interactions and determine their 
      contributions we utilized two genetically inbred, independently isolated Apc(Min) 
      mouse colonies that have been separated for over 20 generations. Whole genome 
      sequencing was used to identify genetic variants unique to the two substrains. To 
      determine the influence of genetic variants and the impact of differences in the 
      GM on phenotypic variability, we used complex microbiota targeted rederivation to 
      generate two Apc mutant mouse colonies harboring complex GMs from two different 
      sources (GMJAX originally from JAX or GMHSD originally from Envigo), creating 
      four Apc(Min) groups. Untargeted metabolomics were used to characterize shifts in 
      the fecal metabolite profile based on genetic variation and differences in the 
      GM. RESULTS: WGS revealed several thousand high quality variants unique to the 
      two substrains. No homozygous variants were present in coding regions, with the 
      vast majority of variants residing in noncoding regions. Host genetic divergence 
      between Min/J and Min/D and the complex GM additively determined differential 
      adenoma susceptibility. Untargeted metabolomics revealed that both genetic 
      lineage and the GM collectively determined the fecal metabolite profile, and that 
      each differentially regulates bile acid (BA) metabolism. Metabolomics pathway 
      analysis facilitated identification of a functionally relevant private noncoding 
      variant associated with the bile acid transporter Fatty acid binding protein 6 
      (Fabp6). Expression studies demonstrated differential expression of Fabp6 between 
      Min/J and Min/D, and the variant correlates with adenoma multiplicity in 
      backcrossed mice. CONCLUSIONS: We found that both genetic variation and 
      differences in microbiota influences the quantitiative adenoma phenotype in 
      Apc(Min) mice. These findings demonstrate how the use of metabolomics datasets 
      can aid as a functional genomic tool, and furthermore illustrate the power of a 
      multi-omics approach to dissect complex disease susceptibility of noncoding 
      variants.

AB  - Colon cancer induces a state of mucosal dysbiosis with associated niche specific 
      changes in the gut microbiota. However, the key metabolic functions of these 
      bacteria remain unclear. We performed a prospective observational study in 
      patients undergoing elective surgery for colon cancer without mechanical bowel 
      preparation (n = 18). Using 16 S rRNA gene sequencing we demonstrated that 
      microbiota ecology appears to be cancer stage-specific and strongly associated 
      with histological features of poor prognosis. Fusobacteria (p < 0.007) and ε- 
      Proteobacteria (p < 0.01) were enriched on tumour when compared to adjacent 
      normal mucosal tissue, and fusobacteria and β-Proteobacteria levels increased 
      with advancing cancer stage (p = 0.014 and 0.002 respecitvely). Metabonomic 
      analysis using 1H Magic Angle Spinning Nuclear Magnetic Resonsance  (MAS-NMR) 
      spectroscopy, demonstrated increased abundance of taurine, isoglutamine, choline, 
      lactate, phenylalanine and tyrosine and decreased levels of lipids and 
      triglycerides in tumour relative to adjacent healthy tissue. Network analysis 
      revealed that bacteria associated with poor prognostic features were not 
      responsible for the modification of the cancer mucosal metabonome. Thus the colon 
      cancer mucosal microbiome evolves with cancer stage to meet the demands of cancer 
      metabolism. Passenger microbiota may play a role in the maintenance of cancer 
      mucosal metabolic homeostasis but these metabolic functions may not be stage

TI  - Association Between Sulfur-Metabolizing Bacterial Communities in Stool and Risk

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Sulfur-metabolizing microbes, which convert dietary sources of 
      sulfur into genotoxic hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S), have been associated with 
      development of colorectal cancer (CRC). We identified a dietary pattern 
      associated with sulfur-metabolizing bacteria in stool and then investigated its 
      association with risk of incident CRC using data from a large prospective study 
      of men. METHODS: We collected data from 51,529 men enrolled in the Health 
      Professionals Follow-up Study since 1986 to determine the association between 
      sulfur-metabolizing bacteria in stool and risk of CRC over 26 years of follow-up. 
      First, in a subcohort of 307 healthy men, we profiled serial stool metagenomes 
      and metatranscriptomes and assessed diet using semiquantitative food frequency 
      questionnaires to identify food groups associated with 43 bacterial species 
      involved in sulfur metabolism. We used these data to develop a sulfur microbial 
      dietary score. We then used Cox proportional hazards modeling to evaluate 
      adherence to this pattern among eligible individuals (n = 48,246) from 1986 
      through 2012 with risk for incident CRC. RESULTS: Foods associated with higher 
      sulfur microbial diet scores included increased consumption of processed meats 
      and low-calorie drinks and lower consumption of vegetables and legumes. Increased 
      sulfur microbial diet scores were associated with risk of distal colon and rectal 
      cancers, after adjusting for other risk factors (multivariable relative risk, 
      highest vs lowest quartile, 1.43; 95% confidence interval 1.14-1.81; P-trend = 
      .002). In contrast, sulfur microbial diet scores were not associated with risk of 
      proximal colon cancer (multivariable relative risk 0.86; 95% CI 0.65-1.14; 
      P-trend = .31). CONCLUSIONS: In an analysis of participants in the Health 
      Professionals Follow-up Study, we found that long-term adherence to a dietary 
      pattern associated with sulfur-metabolizing bacteria in stool was associated with 
      an increased risk of distal CRC. Further studies are needed to determine how 
      sulfur-metabolizing bacteria might contribute to CRC pathogenesis.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Patients with multiple recurrent Clostridioides difficile 
      infection (rCDI) have a disturbed gut microbiota that can be restored by fecal 
      microbiota transplantation (FMT). Despite extensive screening, healthy feces 
      donors may carry bacteria in their intestinal tract that could have long-term 
      health effects, such as potentially procarcinogenic polyketide synthase-positive 
      (pks(+)) Escherichia coli. Here, we aim to determine whether the pks abundance 
      and persistence of pks(+)E coli is influenced by pks status of the donor feces. 
      METHODS: In a cohort of 49 patients with rCDI treated with FMT and matching donor 
      samples-the largest cohort of its kind, to our knowledge-we retrospectively 
      screened fecal metagenomes for pks(+)E coli and compared the presence of pks in 
      patients before and after treatment and to their respective donors. RESULTS: The 
      pks island was more prevalent (P = .026) and abundant (P < .001) in patients with 
      rCDI (pre-FMT, 27 of 49 [55%]; median, 0.46 reads per kilobase per million [RPKM] 
      pks) than in healthy donors (3 of 8 donors [37.5%], 11 of 38 samples [29%]; 
      median, 0.01 RPKM pks). The pks status of patients post-FMT depended on the pks 
      status of the donor suspension with which the patient was treated (P = .046). 
      Particularly, persistence (8 of 9 cases) or clearance (13 of 18) of pks(+)E coli 
      in pks(+) patients was correlated to pks in the donor (P = .004). CONCLUSIONS: We 
      conclude that FMT contributes to pks(+)E coli persistence or eradication in 
      patients with rCDI but that donor-to-patient transmission of pks(+)E coli is 
      unlikely.

      Many diseases are traceable to microbiota dysbiosis, implicating altered gut 
      microbial ecosystems, or, in many cases, disrupted microbial enzymes carrying out 
      essential physio-biochemical reactions. Thus, the changes of essential microbial 
      enzyme levels may predict human disorders. With the rapid development of 
      high-throughput sequencing technologies, metagenomics analysis has emerged as an 
      important method to explore the microbial communities in the human body, as well 
      as their functionalities. In this study, we analyzed 156 gut metagenomics samples 
      from patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) and adenoma, as well as that from 
      healthy controls. We estimated the abundance of microbial enzymes using the HMP 
      Unified Metabolic Analysis Network method and identified the differentially 
      abundant enzymes between CRCs and controls. We constructed enzymatic association 
      networks using the extended local similarity analysis algorithm. We identified 
      CRC-associated enzymic changes by analyzing the topological features of the 
      enzymatic association networks, including the clustering coefficient, the 
      betweenness centrality, and the closeness centrality of network nodes. The 
      network topology of enzymatic association network exhibited a difference between 
      the healthy and the CRC environments. The ABC (ATP binding cassette) transporter 
      and small subunit ribosomal protein S19 enzymes, had the highest clustering 
      coefficient in the healthy enzymatic networks. In contrast, the 
      Adenosylhomocysteinase enzyme had the highest clustering coefficient in the CRC 
      enzymatic networks. These enzymic and metabolic differences may serve as risk 
      predictors for CRCs and are worthy of further research.

AB  - Gut microbes programme their metabolism to suit intestinal conditions and convert 
      dietary components into a panel of small molecules that ultimately affect host 
      physiology. To unveil what is behind the effects of key dietary components on 
      microbial functions and the way they modulate host-microbe interaction, we used 
      for the first time a multi-omic approach that goes behind the mere gut 
      phylogenetic composition and provides an overall picture of the functional 
      repertoire in 27 fecal samples from omnivorous, vegan and vegetarian volunteers. 
      Based on our data, vegan and vegetarian diets were associated to the highest 
      abundance of microbial genes/proteins responsible for cell motility, 
      carbohydrate- and protein-hydrolyzing enzymes, transport systems and the 
      synthesis of essential amino acids and vitamins. A positive correlation was 
      observed when intake of fiber and the relative fecal abundance of flagellin were 
      compared. Microbial cells and flagellin extracted from fecal samples of 61 
      healthy donors modulated the viability of the human (HT29) colon carcinoma cells 
      and the host response through the stimulation of the expression of Toll-like 
      receptor 5, lectin RegIIIα and three interleukins (IL-8, IL-22 and IL-23). Our 
      findings concretize a further and relevant milestone on how the diet may 
      prevent/mitigate disease risk.

AB  - Viruses are increasingly viewed as vital components of the human gut microbiota, 
      while their roles in health and diseases remain incompletely understood. Here, we 
      first sequenced and analyzed the 37 metagenomic and 18 host metabolomic samples 
      related to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and found that some shifted viruses 
      between IBS and controls covaried with shifted bacteria and metabolites. 
      Especially, phages that infect beneficial lactic acid bacteria depleted in IBS 
      covaried with their hosts. We also retrieved public whole-genome metagenomic 
      datasets of another four diseases (type 2 diabetes, Crohn's disease, colorectal 
      cancer, and liver cirrhosis), totaling 438 samples including IBS, and performed 
      uniform analysis of the gut viruses in diseases. By constructing disease-specific 
      co-occurrence networks, we found viruses actively interacting with bacteria, 
      negatively correlated with possible dysbiosis-related and inflammation-mediating 
      bacteria, increasing the connectivity between bacteria modules, and contributing 
      to the robustness of the networks. Functional enrichment analysis showed that 
      phages interact with bacteria through predation or expressing genes involved in 
      the transporter and secretion system, metabolic enzymes, etc. We further built a 
      viral database to facilitate systematic functional classification and explored 
      the functions of viral genes on interacting with bacteria. Our analyses provided 
      a systematic view of the gut virome in the disease-related microbial community 
      and suggested possible positive roles of viruses concerning gut health.

TI  - The human gut microbiome: implications for future health care.
PG  - 396-403
AB  - In their intestine, humans possess an "extended genome" of millions of microbial 
      genes-the microbiome. Because this complex symbiosis influences host metabolism, 
      physiology, and gene expression, it has been proposed that humans are complex 
      biologic "superorganisms." Advances in microbiologic analysis and systems biology 
      are now beginning to implicate the gut microbiome in the etiology of localized 
      intestinal diseases such as the irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel 
      disease, and colon cancer. These approaches also suggest possible links between 
      the gut and previously unassociated systemic conditions such as type 2 diabetes 
      and obesity. The elucidation of the intestinal microbiome is therefore likely to 
      underpin future disease prevention strategies, personalized health care regimens, 
      and the development of novel therapeutic interventions. This review summarizes 
      the research that is defining our understanding of the intestinal microbiome and 
      highlights future areas of research in gastroenterology and human health in which 
      the intestinal microbiome will play a significant role.

      implications.
PG  - 719-30
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2011.51 [doi]
AB  - Chronic inflammatory diseases, depending upon the duration and severity, are 
      frequently associated with an increased risk of developing cancer. A classic 
      paradigm is the enhanced risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) in patients with 
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Carcinogenesis is a multifactorial process that 
      involves accumulation of genetic defects, protein modification, and cell-matrix 
      interaction. In this review, we discuss aspects of chronic inflammation in IBD 
      that influence the development of CRC and highlight the key molecular mediators 
      involved in this process. Also, we identify potential targets that could 
      facilitate earlier detection of dysplasia. The targeted manipulation of specific 
      molecules or pathways could provide opportunities for the development of 
      therapeutic and chemopreventive interventions, which may prove effective in 
      arresting the progression of colitis-associated cancer (CAC), with clinical 
      implications.

AB  - Early in the 1900s, it was proposed that health could be improved and senility 
      delayed by manipulating gut microbiota with the host-friendly bacteria found in 
      yogurt. Later, in 1990, the medical community reconsidered this idea and today 
      probiotics represent a developed area of research with a billion-dollar global 
      industry. As a result, in recent decades, increased attention has been paid to 
      the isolation and characterization of novel probiotic bacteria from fermented 
      foods and dairy products. Most of the identified probiotic strains belong to the 
      lactic acid bacteria group and the genus Bifidobacterium. However, current 
      molecular-based knowledge has allowed the identification and culture of 
      obligatory anaerobic commensal bacteria from the human gut, such as Akkermansia 
      spp. and Faecalibacterium spp., among other human symbionts. We are aware that 
      the identification of new strains of these species does not guarantee their 
      probiotic effects and that each effect must be proved through in vitro and in 
      vivo preclinical studies before clinical trials (before even considering it as a 
      probiotic strain). In most cases, the identification and characterization of new 
      probiotic strain candidates may lack the appropriate set of in vitro experiments 
      allowing the next assessment steps. Here, we address some innovative strategies 
      reported in the literature as alternatives to classical characterization: (i) 
      identification of alternatives using whole-metagenome shotgun sequencing, 
      metabolomics, and multi-omics analysis; and (ii) probiotic characterization based 
      on molecular effectors and/or traits to target specific diseases (i.e., 
      inflammatory bowel diseases, colorectal cancer, allergies, among others).

AB  - Intestinal microbiota is essential for gut homeostasis. Specifically, the 
      microorganisms inhabiting the gut lumen interact with the intestinal immune 
      system, supply key nutrients for the major components of the gut wall, and 
      modulate energy metabolism. Host-microbiome interactions can be either beneficial 
      or deleterious, driving gastrointestinal lymphoid tissue activities and shaping 
      gut wall structures. This overview briefly focuses on the potential role played 
      by abnormalities in gut microbiota and relative responses of the gastrointestinal 
      tract in the determination of important pathological conditions such as the 
      irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel diseases and colorectal cancer.

TI  - Diversity and distribution of sulfur metabolic genes in the human gut microbiome 
      and their association with colorectal cancer.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent evidence implicates microbial sulfidogenesis as a potential 
      trigger of colorectal cancer (CRC), highlighting the need for comprehensive 
      knowledge of sulfur metabolism within the human gut. Microbial sulfidogenesis 
      produces genotoxic hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) in the human colon using inorganic 
      (sulfate) and organic (taurine/cysteine/methionine) substrates; however, the 
      majority of studies have focused on sulfate reduction using dissimilatory sulfite 
      reductases (Dsr). RESULTS: Here, we show that genes for microbial sulfur 
      metabolism are more abundant and diverse than previously observed and are 
      statistically associated with CRC. Using ~ 17,000 bacterial genomes from publicly 
      available stool metagenomes, we studied the diversity of sulfur metabolic genes 
      in 667 participants across different health statuses: healthy, adenoma, and 
      carcinoma. Sulfidogenic genes were harbored by 142 bacterial genera and both 
      organic and inorganic sulfidogenic genes were associated with carcinoma. 
      Significantly, the anaerobic sulfite reductase (asr) genes were twice as abundant 
      as dsr, demonstrating that Asr is likely a more important contributor to sulfate 
      reduction in the human gut than Dsr. We identified twelve potential pathways for 
      reductive taurine metabolism and discovered novel genera harboring these 
      pathways. Finally, the prevalence of metabolic genes for organic sulfur indicates 
      that these understudied substrates may be the most abundant source of microbially 
      derived H(2)S. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings significantly expand knowledge of 
      microbial sulfur metabolism in the human gut. We show that genes for microbial 
      sulfur metabolism in the human gut are more prevalent than previously known, 
      irrespective of health status (i.e., in both healthy and diseased states). Our 
      results significantly increase the diversity of pathways and bacteria that are 
      associated with microbial sulfur metabolism in the human gut. Overall, our 
      results have implications for understanding the role of the human gut microbiome 
      and its potential contributions to the pathogenesis of CRC. Video abstract.

TI  - High-Fiber, Whole-Food Dietary Intervention Alters the Human Gut Microbiome but 
      Not Fecal Short-Chain Fatty Acids.
LID - 10.1128/mSystems.00115-21 [doi]
LID - e00115-21
AB  - Dietary shifts can have a direct impact on the gut microbiome by preferentially 
      selecting for microbes capable of utilizing the various dietary nutrients. The 
      intake of dietary fiber has decreased precipitously in the last century, while 
      consumption of processed foods has increased. Fiber, or microbiota-accessible 
      carbohydrates (MACs), persist in the digestive tract and can be metabolized by 
      specific bacteria encoding fiber-degrading enzymes. The digestion of MACs results 
      in the accumulation of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and other metabolic 
      by-products that are critical to human health. Here, we implemented a 2-week 
      dietary fiber intervention aiming for 40 to 50 g of fiber per day within the 
      context of a course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) (n = 20). By 
      coupling shotgun metagenomic sequencing and targeted gas chromatography-mass 
      spectrometry (GC-MS), we found that the dietary intervention significantly 
      altered the composition of individual gut microbiomes, accounting for 8.3% of the 
      longitudinal variability within subjects. Notably, microbial taxa that increased 
      in relative abundance as a result of the diet change included known MAC degraders 
      (i.e., Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus). We further assessed the genetic 
      diversity within Bifidobacterium, assayed by amplification of the groEL gene. 
      Concomitant with microbial composition changes, we show an increase in the 
      abundance of genes involved in inositol degradation. Despite these changes in gut 
      microbiome composition, we did not detect a consistent shift in SCFA abundance. 
      Collectively, our results demonstrate that on a short-term timescale of 2 weeks, 
      increased fiber intake can induce compositional changes of the gut microbiome, 
      including an increase in MAC-degrading bacteria.IMPORTANCE A profound decrease in 
      the consumption of dietary fiber in many parts of the world in the last century 
      may be associated with the increasing prevalence of type II diabetes, colon 
      cancer, and other health problems. A typical U.S. diet includes about ∼15 g of 
      fiber per day, far less fiber than the daily recommended allowance. Changes in 
      dietary fiber intake affect human health not only through the uptake of nutrients 
      directly but also indirectly through changes in the microbial community and their 
      associated metabolism. Here, we conducted a 2-week diet intervention in healthy 
      young adults to investigate the impact of fiber consumption on the gut 
      microbiome. Participants increased their average fiber consumption by 25 g/day on 
      average for 2 weeks. The high-fiber diet intervention altered the gut microbiome 
      of the study participants, including increases in known fiber-degrading microbes, 
      such as Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus.

TI  - The ColoCare Study: A Paradigm of Transdisciplinary Science in Colorectal Cancer 
      Outcomes.
PG  - 591-601
LID - 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-18-0773 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer is a leading cause of cancer death. Biomarkers to 
      predict treatment outcomes are needed, as is evidence whether postdiagnosis diet 
      and lifestyle can affect well-being and clinical outcomes. The international 
      ColoCare Consortium aims to identify new biologic markers (e.g., metabolomic, 
      transcriptomic, metagenomic, genetic, epigenetic, proteomic markers) that predict 
      clinical outcomes, and to characterize associations between modifiable risk 
      factors (e.g., diet, supplement use, physical activity) with short-term and 
      long-term patient-reported and clinical outcomes among patients with colorectal 
      cancer.Methods/Results: ColoCare is recruiting newly diagnosed patients with 
      colorectal cancer across six sites in the United States and one site in Germany. 
      As of April 2018, we have recruited >2,000 patients across all sites. Our 
      projected enrollment is >4,000 multiethnic patients with colorectal cancer. The 
      study includes uniformly collected, comprehensive sets of data and biospecimens 
      at multiple time points up to 5 years after diagnosis. Treatment and clinical 
      data are abstracted from medical records and centrally harmonized. Biospecimens 
      are archived according to standardized procedures. Our initial studies 
      demonstrated metabolic differences in adipose tissue types. We further reported 
      on associations of biological factors (e.g., inflammation, DNA methylation, 
      metabolomics) with lifestyle factors (e.g., adiposity, smoking, physical 
      activity, dietary supplement use) or joint associations with clinical outcomes. 
      CONCLUSIONS: ColoCare is a consortium for the investigation of multilevel factors 
      relevant to colorectal cancer survivorship. IMPACT: The combination of a 
      comprehensive set of biospecimens collected at multiple time points, jointly with 
      detailed assessments of health behaviors and other prognostic factors, results in 
      a unique resource that facilitates wide-ranging, innovative, and impactful 
      research on colorectal cancer.

AB  - Human gut bacterial Na(+)-transporting NADH:ubiquinone reductase (NQR) sequence 
      is associated with Alzheimer disease (AD). Here, Alzheimer disease-associated 
      sequence (ADAS) is further characterized in cultured spore-forming Clostridium 
      sp. Tryptophan and NQR substrate ubiquinone have common precursor chorismate in 
      microbial shikimate pathway. Tryptophan-derived tryptamine presents in human diet 
      and gut microbiome. Tryptamine inhibits tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (TrpRS) with 
      consequent neurodegeneration in cell and animal models. Tryptophanyl-tRNA 
      synthetase inhibition causes protein biosynthesis impairment similar to that 
      revealed in AD. Tryptamine-induced TrpRS gene-dose reduction is associated with 
      TrpRS protein deficiency and cell death. In animals, tryptamine treatment results 
      in toxicity, weight gain, and prediabetes-related hypoglycemia. Sequence analysis 
      of gut microbiome database reveals 89% to 100% ADAS nucleotide identity in 
      American Indian (Cheyenne and Arapaho [C&A]) Oklahomans, of which ~93% being 
      overweight or obese and 50% self-reporting type 2 diabetes (T2D). Alzheimer 
      disease-associated sequence occurs in 10.8% of C&A vs 1.3% of healthy American 
      population. This observation is of considerable interest because T2D links to AD 
      and obesity. Alzheimer disease-associated sequence prevails in gut microbiome of 
      colorectal cancer, which linked to AD. Metabolomics revealed that tryptamine, 
      chorismate precursor quinate, and chorismate product 4-hydroxybenzoate 
      (ubiquinone precursor) are significantly higher, while tryptophan-containing 
      dipeptides are lower due to tRNA aminoacylation deficiency in C&A compared with 
      non-native Oklahoman who showed no ADAS. Thus, gut microbial tryptamine 
      overproduction correlates with ADAS occurrence. Antibiotic and diet additives 
      induce ADAS and tryptamine. Mitogenic/cytotoxic tryptamine cause microbial and 
      human cell death, gut dysbiosis, and consequent disruption of host-microbe 
      homeostasis. Present analysis of 1246 participants from 17 human gut metagenomics 
      studies revealed ADAS in cell death diseases.

TI  - Microbial genetic and transcriptional contributions to oxalate degradation by the 
      gut microbiota in health and disease.
LID - 10.7554/eLife.63642 [doi]
LID - e63642
AB  - Over-accumulation of oxalate in humans may lead to nephrolithiasis and 
      nephrocalcinosis. Humans lack endogenous oxalate degradation pathways (ODP), but 
      intestinal microbes can degrade oxalate using multiple ODPs and protect against 
      its absorption. The exact oxalate-degrading taxa in the human microbiota and 
      their ODP have not been described. We leverage multi-omics data (>3000 samples 
      from >1000 subjects) to show that the human microbiota primarily uses the type II 
      ODP, rather than type I. Furthermore, among the diverse ODP-encoding microbes, an 
      oxalate autotroph, Oxalobacter formigenes, dominates this function 
      transcriptionally. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) frequently 
      suffer from disrupted oxalate homeostasis and calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis. We 
      show that the enteric oxalate level is elevated in IBD patients, with highest 
      levels in Crohn's disease (CD) patients with both ileal and colonic involvement 
      consistent with known nephrolithiasis risk. We show that the microbiota ODP 
      expression is reduced in IBD patients, which may contribute to the disrupted 
      oxalate homeostasis. The specific changes in ODP expression by several important 
      taxa suggest that they play distinct roles in IBD-induced nephrolithiasis risk. 
      Lastly, we colonize mice that are maintained in the gnotobiotic facility with O. 
      formigenes, using either a laboratory isolate or an isolate we cultured from 
      human stools, and observed a significant reduction in host fecal and urine 
      oxalate levels, supporting our in silico prediction of the importance of the 
      microbiome, particularly O. formigenes in host oxalate homeostasis.

AB  - Chronic infection and associated inflammation have long been suspected to promote 
      human carcinogenesis. Recently, certain gut bacteria, including some in the 
      Fusobacterium genus, have been implicated in playing a role in human colorectal 
      cancer development. However, the Fusobacterium species and subspecies involved 
      and their oncogenic mechanisms remain to be determined. We sought to identify the 
      specific Fusobacterium spp. and ssp. in clinical colorectal cancer specimens by 
      targeted sequencing of Fusobacterium 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Five Fusobacterium 
      spp. were identified in clinical colorectal cancer specimens. Additional analyses 
      confirmed that Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. animalis was the most prevalent F. 
      nucleatum subspecies in human colorectal cancers. We also assessed inflammatory 
      cytokines in colorectal cancer specimens using immunoassays and found that 
      expression of the cytokines IL17A and TNFα was markedly increased but IL21 
      decreased in the colorectal tumors. Furthermore, the chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 
      20 was differentially expressed in colorectal tumors at all stages. In in vitro 
      co-culture assays, F. nucleatum ssp. animalis induced CCL20 protein expression in 
      colorectal cancer cells and monocytes. It also stimulated the monocyte/macrophage 
      activation and migration. Our observations suggested that infection with F. 
      nucleatum ssp. animalis in colorectal tissue could induce inflammatory response 
      and promote colorectal cancer development. Further studies are warranted to 
      determine if F. nucleatum ssp. animalis could be a novel target for colorectal 
      cancer prevention and treatment. Cancer Prev Res; 10(7); 398-409. ©2017 AACR.

TI  - The Gut Microbiome Is Associated With Therapeutic Responses and Toxicities of 
      Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy in Rectal Cancer Patients-A Pilot Study.

AB  - Responses to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) and therapy-related toxicities 
      in rectal cancer vary among patients. To provide the individualized therapeutic 
      option for each patient, predictive markers of therapeutic responses and 
      toxicities are in critical need. We aimed to identify the association of gut 
      microbiome with and its potential predictive value for therapeutic responses and 
      toxicities. In the present study, we collected fecal microbiome samples from 
      patients with rectal cancer at treatment initiation and just after nCRT. 
      Taxonomic profiling via 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing was performed on all 
      samples. Patients were classified as responders versus non-responders. Patients 
      were grouped into no or mild diarrhea and severe diarrhea. STAMP and 
      high-dimensional class comparisons via linear discriminant analysis of effect 
      size (LEfSe) were used to compare the compositional differences between groups. 
      Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States 
      (PICRUSt) was utilized to predict differences in metabolic function between 
      groups. Ten patients were classified as responders and 12 patients were 
      classified as non-responders. Fourteen patients experienced no or mild diarrhea 
      and 8 patients experienced severe diarrhea. Several bacteria taxa with 
      significantly different relative abundances before and after nCRT were 
      identified. Similarly, several baseline bacteria taxa and predicted pathways with 
      significantly different relative abundances between responders and non-responders 
      or between patients no or mild diarrhea and severe diarrhea were identified. 
      Specifically, Shuttleworthia was identified as enriched in responders and several 
      bacteria taxa in the Clostridiales order etc. were identified as enriched in 
      non-responders. Pathways including fatty acid metabolism were predicted to be 
      enriched in responders. In addition, Bifidobacterium, Clostridia, and Bacteroides 
      etc. were identified as enriched in patients with no or mild diarrhea. Pathways 
      including primary bile acid biosynthesis were predicted to be enriched in 
      patients with no or mild diarrhea. Together, the microbiota and pathway markers 
      identified in this study may be utilized to predict the therapeutic responses and 
      therapy-related toxicities of nCRT in patients with rectal cancer. More patient 
      data is needed to verify the current findings and the results of metagenomic, 
      metatranscriptomic, and metabolomic analyses will further mine key biomarkers at 
      the compositional and functional level.

TI  - Colonic methane production modifies gastrointestinal toxicity associated with 
      adjuvant 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy for colorectal cancer.
PG  - 45-51

AB  - GOALS: To investigate the association of colonic methane, formed by methanogenic 
      achaea, and pH with gastrointestinal symptoms during colorectal cancer 
      chemotherapy. BACKGROUND: Adjuvant 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy reduces 
      recurrences in colorectal cancer, but causes severe gastrointestinal toxicity, 
      partly related to disturbed intestinal microbiota. STUDY: Resected colorectal 
      cancer patients (n=143) were analyzed for colonic methanogenesis and pH before 
      and during the 24 weeks of 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy and for gastrointestinal 
      symptoms during chemotherapy. This study was performed within the setting of an 
      intervention study on the effects of Lactobacillus on chemotherapy-related 
      gastrointestinal toxicity. The site of resected cancer, resection type, stoma, 
      chemotherapy regimen, hypolactasia, and Lactobacillus intervention were 
      considered as possible confounding factors, and multivariate models were 
      constructed. RESULTS: Baseline methane producers had less frequent diarrhea (more 
      than or equal to moderate) during chemotherapy than nonproducers [odds ratio 
      (OR), 0.42; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.20 to 0.88; P=0.022] and more 
      frequent constipation (OR, 4.56; 95% CI, 2.01 to 10.32; P<0.001). Baseline fecal 
      pH was also associated with symptoms during chemotherapy; higher the pH, the 
      lower the risk of diarrhea (OR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.31 to 1.02; P=0.058) and higher 
      the risk of constipation (OR, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.35 to 3.68; P=0.002). In 
      multivariate stepwise models, methanogenesis was a significant explaining factor 
      with inverse association with diarrhea and positive association with 
      constipation. Fecal pH, which was significantly associated with methane 
      production, was no longer a significant explaining factor when methanogensis was 
      included in the model. CONCLUSIONS: Methane producer status has a role in 
      determining whether patient experiences diarrhea or constipation during 
      5-fluorouracil therapy. This underscores the importance of intestinal microbiota 
      in the development of intestinal toxicity during 5-fluorouracil therapy.

TI  - Traditional Processed Meat Products Re-designed Towards Inulin-rich Functional 
      Foods Reduce Polyps in Two Colorectal Cancer Animal Models.
PG  - 14783
LID - 10.1038/s41598-019-51437-w [doi]
LID - 14783
AB  - Inulin-rich foods exert a prebiotic effect, as this polysaccharide is able to 
      enhance beneficial colon microbiota populations, giving rise to the in situ 
      production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) such as propionic and butyric 
      acids. These SCFAs are potent preventive agents against colorectal cancer due to 
      their histone deacetylases inhibitory properties, which induce apoptosis in tumor 
      colonocytes. As colorectal cancer is the fourth most common neoplasia in Europe 
      with 28.2 new cases per 100,000 inhabitants, a cost-effective preventive strategy 
      has been tested in this work by redesigning common porcine meat products (chorizo 
      sausages and cooked ham) consumed by a substantial proportion of the population 
      towards potential colorectal cancer preventive functional foods. In order to test 
      the preventive effect of these inulin-rich meat products against colorectal 
      cancer, an animal model (Rattus norvegicus F344) was used, involving two doses of 
      azoxymethane (10 mg/kg) and two treatments with dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) 
      during a 20-week assay period. Control feed, control sausages, functional 
      sausages (15.7% inulin), control cooked ham and functional cooked ham (10% 
      inulin) were used to feed the corresponding animal cohorts. Then, the animals 
      were sacrificed and their digestive tract tissues were analyzed. The results 
      showed a statistically significant 49% reduction in the number of colon polyps in 
      the functional meat products cohorts with respect to the control meat products 
      animals, as well as an increase in the cecum weight (an indicator of a diet rich 
      in prebiotic fiber), a 51.8% increase in colon propionate production, a 39.1% 
      increase in colon butyrate concentrations, and a reduction in the number of 
      hyperplastic Peyer's patches. Metagenomics studies also demonstrated colon 
      microbiota differences, revealing a significant increase in Bacteroidetes 
      populations in the functional meat products (mainly due to an increase in 
      Bacteroidaceae and Prevotellaceae families, which include prominent propionate 
      producers), together with a reduction in Firmicutes (especially due to lower 
      Lachnospiraceae populations). However, functional meat products showed a 
      remarkable increase in the anti-inflammatory and fiber-fermentative Blautia 
      genus, which belongs to this Lachnospiraceae family. The functional meat products 
      cohorts also presented a reduction in important pro-inflammatory bacterial 
      populations, such as those of the genus Desulfovibrio and Bilophila. These 
      results were corroborated in a genetic animal model of CRC 
      (F344/NSlc-Apc(1588/kyo)) that produced similar results. Therefore, processed 
      meat products can be redesigned towards functional prebiotic foods of interest as 
      a cost-effective dietary strategy for preventing colorectal cancer in human 
      populations.

AB  - It is well appreciated that microbial metabolism of drugs can influence treatment 
      efficacy. Microbial β-glucuronidases in the gut can reactivate the excreted, 
      inactive metabolite of irinotecan, a first-line chemotherapeutic for metastatic 
      colorectal cancer. Reactivation causes adverse drug responses, including severe 
      diarrhea. However, a direct connection between irinotecan metabolism and the 
      composition of an individual's gut microbiota has not previously been made. Here, 
      we report quantitative evidence of inter-individual variability in microbiome 
      metabolism of the inactive metabolite of irinotecan to its active form. We 
      identify a high turnover microbiota metabotype with potentially elevated risk for 
      irinotecan-dependent adverse drug responses. We link the high turnover metabotype 
      to unreported microbial β-glucuronidases; inhibiting these enzymes may decrease 
      irinotecan-dependent adverse drug responses in targeted subsets of patients. In 
      total, this study reveals metagenomic mining of the microbiome, combined with 
      metabolomics, as a non-invasive approach to develop biomarkers for colorectal 
      cancer treatment outcomes.

AB  - Streptococcus gallolyticus subspecies gallolyticus (Sgg) has a strong clinical 
      association with colorectal cancer (CRC) and actively promotes the development of 
      colon tumors. However, the molecular determinants involved in Sgg pathogenicity 
      in the gut are unknown. Bacterial type VII secretion systems (T7SS) mediate 
      pathogen interactions with their host and are important for virulence in 
      pathogenic mycobacteria and Staphylococcus aureus. Through genome analysis, we 
      identified a locus in Sgg strain TX20005 that encodes a putative type VII 
      secretion system (designated as SggT7SST05). We showed that core genes within the 
      SggT7SST05 locus are expressed in vitro and in the colon of mice. Western blot 
      analysis showed that SggEsxA, a protein predicted to be a T7SS secretion 
      substrate, is detected in the bacterial culture supernatant, indicating that this 
      SggT7SST05 is functional. Deletion of SggT7SST05 (TX20005Δesx) resulted in 
      impaired bacterial adherence to HT29 cells and abolished the ability of Sgg to 
      stimulate HT29 cell proliferation. Analysis of bacterial culture supernatants 
      suggest that SggT7SST05-secreted factors are responsible for the 
      pro-proliferative activity of Sgg, whereas Sgg adherence to host cells requires 
      both SggT7SST05-secreted and bacterial surface-associated factors. In a murine 
      gut colonization model, TX20005Δesx showed significantly reduced colonization 
      compared to the parent strain. Furthermore, in a mouse model of CRC, mice exposed 
      to TX20005 had a significantly higher tumor burden compared to saline-treated 
      mice, whereas those exposed to TX20005Δesx did not. Examination of the Sgg load 
      in the colon in the CRC model suggests that SggT7SST05-mediated activities are 
      directly involved in the promotion of colon tumors. Taken together, these results 
      reveal SggT7SST05 as a previously unrecognized pathogenicity determinant for Sgg 
      colonization of the colon and promotion of colon tumors.

AB  - Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a heterogeneous disease and recent advances in subtype 
      classification have successfully stratified the disease using molecular 
      profiling. The contribution of bacterial species to CRC development is 
      increasingly acknowledged, and here, we sought to analyse CRC microbiomes and 
      relate them to tumour consensus molecular subtypes (CMS), in order to better 
      understand the relationship between bacterial species and the molecular 
      mechanisms associated with CRC subtypes. We classified 34 tumours into CRC 
      subtypes using RNA-sequencing derived gene expression and determined relative 
      abundances of bacterial taxonomic groups using 16S rRNA amplicon metabarcoding. 
      16S rRNA analysis showed enrichment of Fusobacteria and Bacteroidetes, and 
      decreased levels of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria in CMS1. A more detailed 
      analysis of bacterial taxa using non-human RNA-sequencing reads uncovered 
      distinct bacterial communities associated with each molecular subtype. The most 
      highly enriched species associated with CMS1 included Fusobacterium hwasookii and 
      Porphyromonas gingivalis. CMS2 was enriched for Selenomas and Prevotella species, 
      while CMS3 had few significant associations. Targeted quantitative PCR validated 
      these findings and also showed an enrichment of Fusobacterium nucleatum, 
      Parvimonas micra and Peptostreptococcus stomatis in CMS1. In this study, we have 
      successfully associated individual bacterial species to CRC subtypes for the 
      first time.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The gut microbiota plays an important role in human health and 
      disease by acting as a metabolic organ. Metagenomic sequencing has shown how 
      dysbiosis in the gut microbiota is associated with human metabolic diseases such 
      as obesity and diabetes. Modeling may assist to gain insight into the metabolic 
      implication of an altered microbiota. Fast and accurate reconstruction of 
      metabolic models for members of the gut microbiota, as well as methods to 
      simulate a community of microorganisms, are therefore needed. The Integrated 
      Microbial Genomes (IMG) database contains functional annotation for nearly 4,650 
      bacterial genomes. This tremendous new genomic information adds new opportunities 
      for systems biology to reconstruct accurate genome scale metabolic models (GEMs). 
      RESULTS: Here we assembled a reaction data set containing 2,340 reactions 
      obtained from existing genome-scale metabolic models, where each reaction is 
      assigned with KEGG Orthology. The reaction data set was then used to reconstruct 
      two genome scale metabolic models for gut microorganisms available in the IMG 
      database Bifidobacterium adolescentis L2-32, which produces acetate during 
      fermentation, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii A2-165, which consumes acetate and 
      produces butyrate. F. prausnitzii is less abundant in patients with Crohn's 
      disease and has been suggested to play an anti-inflammatory role in the gut 
      ecosystem. The B. adolescentis model, iBif452, comprises 699 reactions and 611 
      unique metabolites. The F. prausnitzii model, iFap484, comprises 713 reactions 
      and 621 unique metabolites. Each model was validated with in vivo data. We used 
      OptCom and Flux Balance Analysis to simulate how both organisms interact. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The consortium of iBif452 and iFap484 was applied to predict F. 
      prausnitzii's demand for acetate and production of butyrate which plays an 
      essential role in colonic homeostasis and cancer prevention. The assembled 
      reaction set is a useful tool to generate bacterial draft models from KEGG 
      Orthology.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Consuming red and processed meat has been associated with an 
      increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC), which is partly attributed to exposure 
      to carcinogens such as heterocyclic amines (HCA) formed during cooking and 
      preservation processes. The interaction of gut microbes and HCA can result in 
      altered bioactivities and it has been shown previously that human gut microbiota 
      can transform mutagenic HCA to a glycerol conjugate with reduced mutagenic 
      potential. However, the major form of HCA in the colon are glucuronides (HCA-G) 
      and it is not known whether these metabolites, via stepwise microbial hydrolysis 
      and acrolein conjugation, are viable precursors for glycerol conjugated 
      metabolites. We hypothesized that such a process could be concurrently catalyzed 
      by bacterial beta-glucuronidase (B-GUS) and glycerol/diol dehydratase (GDH) 
      activity. We therefore investigated how the HCA-G PhIP-N2-β-D-glucuronide 
      (PhIP-G), a representative liver metabolite of 
      PhIP (2-Amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo [4,5-b] pyridine), which is the most 
      abundant carcinogenic HCA in well-cooked meat, is transformed by enzymatic 
      activity of human gut microbial representatives of the phyla Firmicutes, 
      Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria. RESULTS: We employed a combination of growth 
      and enzymatic assays, and a bioanalysis approach combined with metagenomics. 
      B-GUS of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii converted PhIP-G to PhIP and GDH of 
      Flavonifractor plautii, Blautia obeum, Eubacterium hallii, and Lactobacillus 
      reuteri converted PhIP to PhIP-M1 in the presence of glycerol. In addition, 
      B-GUS- and GDH-positive bacteria cooperatively converted PhIP-G to PhIP-M1. A 
      screen of genes encoding B-GUS and GDH was performed for fecal microbiome data 
      from healthy individuals (n = 103) and from CRC patients (n = 53), which revealed 
      a decrease in abundance of taxa with confirmed GDH and HCA transformation 
      activity in CRC patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study for the first time demonstrates 
      that gut microbes mediate the stepwise transformation of PhIP-G to PhIP-M1 via 
      the intermediate production of PhIP. Findings from this study suggest that 
      targeted manipulation with gut microbes bearing specific functions, or dietary 
      glycerol supplementation might modify gut microbial activity to reduce 
      HCA-induced CRC risk.

TI  - Fecal Short-Chain Fatty Acids Are Not Predictive of Colonic Tumor Status and 
      Cannot Be Predicted Based on Bacterial Community Structure.

AB  - Colonic bacterial populations are thought to have a role in the development of 
      colorectal cancer with some protecting against inflammation and others 
      exacerbating inflammation. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) have been shown to 
      have anti-inflammatory properties and are produced in large quantities by colonic 
      bacteria that produce SCFAs by fermenting fiber. We assessed whether there was an 
      association between fecal SCFA concentrations and the presence of colonic 
      adenomas or carcinomas in a cohort of individuals using 16S rRNA gene and 
      metagenomic shotgun sequence data. We measured the fecal concentrations of 
      acetate, propionate, and butyrate within the cohort and found that there were no 
      significant associations between SCFA concentration and tumor status. When we 
      incorporated these concentrations into random forest classification models 
      trained to differentiate between people with healthy colons and those with 
      adenomas or carcinomas, we found that they did not significantly improve the 
      ability of 16S rRNA gene or metagenomic gene sequence-based models to classify 
      individuals. Finally, we generated random forest regression models trained to 
      predict the concentration of each SCFA based on 16S rRNA gene or metagenomic gene 
      sequence data from the same samples. These models performed poorly and were able 
      to explain at most 14% of the observed variation in the SCFA concentrations. 
      These results support the broader epidemiological data that questions the value 
      of fiber consumption for reducing the risks of colorectal cancer. Although other 
      bacterial metabolites may serve as biomarkers to detect adenomas or carcinomas, 
      fecal SCFA concentrations have limited predictive power.IMPORTANCE Considering 
      that colorectal cancer is the third leading cancer-related cause of death within 
      the United States, it is important to detect colorectal tumors early and to 
      prevent the formation of tumors. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are often used 
      as a surrogate for measuring gut health and for being anticarcinogenic because of 
      their anti-inflammatory properties. We evaluated the fecal SCFA concentrations of 
      a cohort of individuals with different colonic tumor burdens who were previously 
      analyzed to identify microbiome-based biomarkers of tumors. We were unable to 
      find an association between SCFA concentration and tumor burden or use SCFAs to 
      improve our microbiome-based models of classifying people based on their tumor 
      status. Furthermore, we were unable to find an association between the fecal 
      community structure and SCFA concentrations. Our results indicate that the 
      association between fecal SCFAs, the gut microbiome, and tumor burden is weak.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Ketogenic medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) with profound 
      health benefits are commonly found in dairy products, palm kernel oil and coconut 
      oil. We hypothesize that magnesium (Mg) supplementation leads to enhanced gut 
      microbial production of MCFAs and, in turn, increased circulating MCFAs levels. 
      METHODS: We tested this hypothesis in the Personalized Prevention of Colorectal 
      Cancer Trial (PPCCT) (NCT01105169), a double-blind 2 × 2 factorial randomized 
      controlled trial enrolling 240 participants. Six 24-h dietary recalls were 
      performed for all participants at the baseline and during the intervention 
      period. Based on the baseline 24-h dietary recalls, the Mg treatment used a 
      personalized dose of Mg supplementation that would reduce the calcium (Ca): Mg 
      intake ratio to around 2.3. We measured plasma MCFAs, sugars, ketone bodies and 
      tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) metabolites using the Metabolon's global 
      Precision Metabolomics™ LC-MS platform. Whole-genome shotgun metagenomics (WGS) 
      sequencing was performed to assess microbiota in stool samples, rectal swabs, and 
      rectal biopsies. RESULTS: Personalized Mg treatment (mean dose 205.58 mg/day with 
      a range from 77.25 to 389.55 mg/day) significantly increased the plasma levels of 
      C7:0, C8:0, and combined C7:0 and C8:0 by 18.45%, 25.28%, and 24.20%, 
      respectively, compared to 14.15%, 10.12%, and 12.62% decreases in the placebo 
      arm. The effects remain significant after adjusting for age, sex, race and 
      baseline level (P = 0.0126, P = 0.0162, and P = 0.0031, respectively) and FDR 
      correction at 0.05 (q = 0.0324 for both C7:0 and C8:0). Mg treatment 
      significantly reduced the plasma level of sucrose compared to the placebo arm 
      (P = 0.0036 for multivariable-adjusted and P = 0.0216 for additional FDR 
      correction model) whereas alterations in daily intakes of sucrose, fructose, 
      glucose, maltose and C8:0 from baseline to the end of trial did not differ 
      between two arms. Mediation analysis showed that combined C7:0 and C8:0 partially 
      mediated the effects of Mg treatment on total and individual ketone bodies (P for 
      indirect effect = 0.0045, 0.0043, and 0.03, respectively). The changes in plasma 
      levels of C7:0 and C8:0 were significantly and positively correlated with the 
      alterations in stool microbiome α diversity (r = 0.51, p = 0.0023 and r = 0.34, 
      p = 0.0497, respectively) as well as in stool abundance for the signatures of 
      MCFAs-related microbiota with acyl-ACP thioesterase gene producing C7:0 
      (r = 0.46, p = 0.0067) and C8:0 (r = 0.49, p = 0.003), respectively, following Mg 
      treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Optimizing Ca:Mg intake ratios to around 2.3 through 
      12-week personalized Mg supplementation leads to increased circulating levels of 
      MCFAs (i.e. C7:0 and C8:0), which is attributed to enhanced production from gut 
      microbial fermentation and, maybe, sucrose consumption.

TI  - Distinct roles of histamine H1- and H2-receptor signaling pathways in 
      inflammation-associated colonic tumorigenesis.
PG  - G205-G216
LID - 10.1152/ajpgi.00212.2018 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a well-known risk factor for the development 
      of colorectal cancer. Prior studies have demonstrated that microbial histamine 
      can ameliorate intestinal inflammation in mice. We tested the hypothesis whether 
      microbe-derived luminal histamine suppresses inflammation-associated colon cancer 
      in Apc(min/+) mice. Mice were colonized with the human-derived Lactobacillus 
      reuteri. Chronic inflammation was induced by repeated cycles of low-dose dextran 
      sulfate sodium (DSS). Mice that were given histamine-producing L. reuteri via 
      oral gavage developed fewer colonic tumors, despite the presence of a complex 
      mouse gut microbiome. We further demonstrated that administration of a histamine 
      H1-receptor (H1R) antagonist suppressed tumorigenesis, while administration of 
      histamine H2-receptor (H2R) antagonist significantly increased both tumor number 
      and size. The bimodal functions of histamine include protumorigenic effects 
      through H1R and antitumorigenic effects via H2R, and these results were supported 
      by gene expression profiling studies on tumor specimens of patients with 
      colorectal cancer. Greater ratios of gene expression of H2R ( HRH2) vs. H1R ( 
      HRH1) were correlated with improved overall survival outcomes in patients with 
      colorectal cancer. Additionally, activation of H2R suppressed phosphorylation of 
      mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and inhibited chemokine gene expression 
      induced by H1R activation in colorectal cancer cells. Moreover, the combination 
      of a H1R antagonist and a H2R agonist yielded potent suppression of 
      lipopolysaccharide-induced MAPK signaling in macrophages. Given the impact on 
      intestinal epithelial and immune cells, simultaneous modulation of H1R and H2R 
      signaling pathways may be a promising therapeutic target for the prevention and 
      treatment of inflammation-associated colorectal cancer. NEW & NOTEWORTHY 
      Histamine-producing Lactobacillus reuteri can suppress development of 
      inflammation-associated colon cancer in an established mouse model. The net 
      effects of histamine may depend on the relative activity of H1R and H2R signaling 
      pathways in the intestinal mucosa. Our findings suggest that treatment with H1R 
      or H2R antagonists could yield opposite effects. However, by harnessing the 
      ability to block H1R signaling while stimulating H2R signaling, novel strategies 
      for suppression of intestinal inflammation and colorectal neoplasia could be 
      developed.

AB  - Characterizing the metabolic functions of the gut microbiome in health and 
      disease is pivotal for translating alterations in microbial composition into 
      clinical insights. Two major analysis paradigms have been used to explore the 
      metabolic functions of the microbiome but not systematically integrated with each 
      other: statistical screening approaches, such as metabolome-microbiome 
      association studies, and computational approaches, such as constraint-based 
      metabolic modeling. To combine the strengths of the two analysis paradigms, we 
      herein introduce a set of theoretical concepts allowing for the population 
      statistical treatment of constraint-based microbial community models. To 
      demonstrate the utility of the theoretical framework, we applied it to a public 
      metagenomic dataset consisting of 365 colorectal cancer (CRC) cases and 251 
      healthy controls, shining a light on the metabolic role of Fusobacterium spp. in 
      CRC. We found that (1) glutarate production capability was significantly enriched 
      in CRC microbiomes and mechanistically linked to lysine fermentation in 
      Fusobacterium spp., (2) acetate and butyrate production potentials were lowered 
      in CRC, and (3) Fusobacterium spp. presence had large negative ecological effects 
      on community butyrate production in CRC cases and healthy controls. Validating 
      the model predictions against fecal metabolomics, the in silico frameworks 
      correctly predicted in vivo species metabolite correlations with high accuracy. 
      In conclusion, highlighting the value of combining statistical association 
      studies with in silico modeling, this study provides insights into the metabolic 
      role of Fusobacterium spp. in the gut, while providing a proof of concept for the 
      validity of constraint-based microbial community modeling.

TI  - Akkermansia muciniphila and Helicobacter typhlonius modulate intestinal tumor 
      development in mice.
PG  - 1388-96
LID - 10.1093/carcin/bgv120 [doi]
AB  - Gastrointestinal tumor growth is thought to be promoted by gastrointestinal 
      bacteria and their inflammatory products. We observed that intestine-specific 
      conditional Apc mutant mice (FabplCre;Apc (15lox/+)) developed many more 
      colorectal tumors under conventional than under pathogen-low housing conditions. 
      Shotgun metagenomic sequencing plus quantitative PCR analysis of feces DNA 
      revealed the presence of two bacterial species in conventional mice, absent from 
      pathogen-low mice. One, Helicobacter typhlonius, has not been associated with 
      cancer in man, nor in immune-competent mice. The other species, mucin-degrading 
      Akkermansia muciniphila, is abundantly present in healthy humans, but reduced in 
      patients with inflammatory gastrointestinal diseases and in obese and type 2 
      diabetic mice. Eradication of H.typhlonius in young conventional mice by 
      antibiotics decreased the number of intestinal tumors. Additional presence of 
      A.muciniphila prior to the antibiotic treatment reduced the tumor number even 
      further. Colonization of pathogen-low FabplCre;Apc (15lox/+) mice with 
      H.typhlonius or A.muciniphila increased the number of intestinal tumors, the 
      thickness of the intestinal mucus layer and A.muciniphila colonization without 
      H.typhlonius increased the density of mucin-producing goblet cells. However, dual 
      colonization with H.typhlonius and A.muciniphila significantly reduced the number 
      of intestinal tumors, the mucus layer thickness and goblet cell density to that 
      of control mice. By global microbiota composition analysis, we found a positive 
      association of A.muciniphila, and of H.typhlonius, and a negative association of 
      unclassified Clostridiales with increased tumor burden. We conclude that 
      A.muciniphila and H.typhlonius can modulate gut microbiota composition and 
      intestinal tumor development in mice.

TI  - Dietary Nutrients Involved in One-Carbon Metabolism and Colonic Mucosa-Associated 
      Gut Microbiome in Individuals with an Endoscopically Normal Colon.
LID - 10.3390/nu11030613 [doi]
LID - 613
AB  - One carbon (1C) metabolism nutrients influence epigenetic regulation and they are 
      supplied by diet and synthesized by gut microbiota. We examined the association 
      between dietary consumption of methyl donors (methionine, betaine and choline) 
      and B vitamins (folate, B2, B6, and B12) and the community composition and 
      structure of the colonic mucosa-associated gut microbiota determined by 16S rRNA 
      gene sequencing in 97 colonic biopsies of 35 men. We used the food frequency 
      questionnaire to assess daily consumption of nutrients, and the UPARSE and SILVA 
      databases for operational taxonomic unit classification. The difference in 
      bacterial diversity and taxonomic relative abundance were compared between low 
      versus high consumption of these nutrients. False discover rate (FDR) adjusted p 
      value < 0.05 indicated statistical significance. The bacterial richness and 
      composition differed significantly by the consumption of folate and B vitamins (p 
      < 0.001). Compared with higher consumption, a lower consumption of these 
      nutrients was associated with a lower abundance of Akkermansia (folate), 
      Roseburia (vitamin B2), and Faecalibacterium (vitamins B2, B6, and B12) but a 
      higher abundance of Erysipelatoclostridium (vitamin B2) (FDR p values < 0.05). 
      The community composition and structure of the colonic bacteria differed 
      significantly by dietary consumption of folate and B vitamins.

TI  - Resistant starch: a promising dietary agent for the prevention/treatment of 
      inflammatory bowel disease and bowel cancer.
PG  - 190-4
LID - 10.1097/MOG.0b013e32835b9aa3 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Resistant starch represents a diverse range of indigestible 
      starch-based dietary carbohydrates. Resistant starch has been investigated in the 
      past for its effects on bowel health (pH, epithelial thickness, and apoptosis of 
      colorectal cancer cells); reduction in postprandial glycemia; increased insulin 
      sensitivity; and effects on the gut microbiome. This review highlights advances 
      as resistant starch gains clinical relevance as a potential treatment/preventive 
      tool for diseases such as colorectal cancer (CRC) and diabetes. RECENT FINDINGS: 
      Recent articles have evaluated the comparative physiological effects of different 
      types of resistant starch and investigated the effects of resistant starch on 
      blood lipids, body weight, and defining resistant starch-induced changes to the 
      micriobiome that may be important in health and disease. The most novel and 
      relevant recent data describe a role for resistant starch in ameliorating 
      inflammation; the use of resistant starch for optimal bowel health and prevention 
      of CRC; and, further, that the systemic effects of resistant starch may be 
      important for the treatment of other forms of cancer, such as breast cancer.

AB  - Microorganism residing in the gut has been known to have important roles in the 
      animal body. Microbes and host microenvironment are highly related with host's 
      health including energy metabolism and immune system. Moreover, it reported that 
      gut microbiome is correlated with diseases like obesity in human and dogs. There 
      have been many studies to identify and characterize microbes and their genes in 
      human body. However, there was little information of microbiome in companion 
      animals. Here, we investigated microbiota communities in feaces from twenty - 
      four Beagles (aged 2 years old) and analyzed the taxonomy profile using 
      metagenomics to study the difference among gut microbiome based on body condition 
      score (BCS). gDNA was isolated from feaces, sequenced and clustered. Taxonomy 
      profiling was performed based on the NCBI database. BCS was evaluated once a week 
      according to the description provided by World Small Animal Veterinary 
      Association. Firmicutes phylum was the most abundant followed by Bacteroidetes, 
      Fusobacteria, Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria. That main microbiota in gut were 
      differently distributed based on the BCS. Fusobacteria has been known to be 
      associated with colon cancer in human. Interestingly, Fusobacteria was in the 
      third level from the top in healthy dog's gut microbiome. In addition, 
      Fusobacteria was especially higher in overweight dogs which had 6 scales of BCS. 
      Species Fusobacterium perfoetens was also more abundant when dogs were in BCS 6. 
      It implied that F. perfoetens would be positively related with overweight in 
      dogs. These finding would contribute to further studies of gut microbiome and 
      their functions to improve dog's diets and health condition.

AB  - The gut microbiota strongly impacts the physiology and pathology in the host. To 
      understand the complex interactions between host and gut microbiota, an 
      'integrated omics' approach has been employed, where exhaustive analyses for the 
      different layers of cellular functions, such as epigenomics, transcriptomics and 
      metabolomics, in addition to metagenomics, are combined. With this approach, the 
      mechanisms whereby short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) regulate host defense and the 
      immune system have been elucidated. In a gnotobiotic mouse model of 
      enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli infection, Bifidobacterium-derived acetate can 
      protect from infection-mediated death by changing the gene expression profile of 
      colonic epithelial cells. It has also been shown that gut microbiota-derived 
      butyrate enhances colonic regulatory T-cell differentiation through its 
      epigenetic modulatory ability via histone deacetylase inhibition. SCFAs are 
      involved in many other immunomodulatory effects as well as host 
      pathophysiological conditions. Dysbiosis in the gut has been implicated in the 
      pathogenesis of many diseases. Although the causal relationship of gut microbial 
      dysbiosis and/or metabolites with pathogenesis is mostly unknown, mechanistic 
      insights have been elucidated in some cases. Metabolism in the gut microbiota and 
      host liver produces trimethylamine N-oxide, which is known to aggravate 
      atherosclerosis, and a secondary bile acid deoxycholate, which reportedly induces 
      non-alcoholic steatohepatitis-related hepatocellular carcinoma. It has been 
      reported that secondary bile acids could also induce the differentiation of 
      peripherally derived regulatory T cells in the gut. Further studies on the 
      interactions between the host and gut microbiota could lead to the development of 
      new therapeutic strategies as well as in preventive medicine.

AB  - The human microbiota, which comprises an ensemble of taxonomically and 
      functionally diverse but often mutually cooperating microorganisms, benefits its 
      host by shaping the host immunity, energy harvesting, and digestion of complex 
      carbohydrates as well as production of essential nutrients. Dysbiosis in the 
      human microbiota, especially the gut microbiota, has been reported to be linked 
      to several diseases and metabolic disorders. Recent studies have further 
      indicated that tracking these dysbiotic variations could potentially be exploited 
      as biomarkers of disease states. However, the human microbiota is not geography 
      agnostic, and hence a taxonomy-based (microbiome) biomarker for disease 
      diagnostics has certain limitations. In comparison, (microbiome) function-based 
      biomarkers are expected to have a wider applicability. Given that (i) the host 
      physiology undergoes certain changes in the course of a disease and (ii) 
      host-associated microbial communities need to adapt to this changing 
      microenvironment of their host, we hypothesized that signatures emanating from 
      the abundance of bacterial proteins associated with the signal transduction 
      system (herein referred to as sensory proteins [SPs]) might be able to 
      distinguish between healthy and diseased states. To test this hypothesis, 
      publicly available metagenomic data sets corresponding to three diverse health 
      conditions, namely, colorectal cancer, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and 
      schizophrenia, were analyzed. Results demonstrated that SP signatures (derived 
      from host-associated metagenomic samples) indeed differentiated among healthy 
      individual and patients suffering from diseases of various severities. Our 
      finding was suggestive of the prospect of using SP signatures as early biomarkers 
      for diagnosing the onset and progression of multiple diseases and metabolic 
      disorders. IMPORTANCE The composition of the human microbiota, a collection of 
      host-associated microbes, has been shown to differ among healthy and diseased 
      individuals. Recent studies have investigated whether tracking these variations 
      could be exploited for disease diagnostics. It has been noted that compared to 
      microbial taxonomies, the ensemble of functional proteins encoded by microbial 
      genes are less likely to be affected by changes in ethnicity and dietary 
      preferences. These functions are expected to help the microbe adapt to changing 
      environmental conditions. Thus, healthy individuals might harbor a different set 
      of genes than diseased individuals. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed 
      metagenomes from healthy and diseased individuals for signatures of a particular 
      group of proteins called sensory proteins (SP), which enable the bacteria to 
      sense and react to changes in their microenvironment. Results demonstrated that 
      SP signatures indeed differentiate among healthy individuals and those suffering 
      from diseases of various severities.

AB  - Metabolic activities of the microbial population are important to maintain the 
      balance of almost all the ecosystems on earth. In the human gut environment, 
      these microbial communities play essential roles in digestion and help to 
      maintain biochemical homeostasis by synthesizing several vital metabolic 
      compounds. Imbalance in the microbial abundance and community structure in the 
      human gut microbiota leads to different diseases and metabolic disorders. 
      Studying the metabolic interplay between the microbial consortia within the host 
      environment is the key to exploring the cause behind the development of various 
      diseases condition. However, mapping the entire biochemical characteristic of 
      human gut microbiota may not be feasible only through experimental approaches. 
      Therefore, the advanced systems biology approach, i.e., metagenome-scale 
      community metabolic modelling, is introduced for understanding the metabolic role 
      and interaction pattern of the entire microbiome. This in silico method directly 
      uses the metagenomic information to model the microbial communities, which mimic 
      the metabolic behavior of the human gut microbiome. This review discusses the 
      recent development of metagenome-scale community metabolic model reconstruction 
      tools and their application in studying the inter-link between the human gut 
      microbiome and health. The application of the community metabolic models to study 
      the metabolic profile of the human gut microbiome has also been investigated. 
      Alteration of the metabolic fluxes associated with different biochemical 
      activities in type 1 diabetics, type 2 diabetics, inflammatory bowel diseases 
      (IBD), gouty arthritis, colorectal cancer (CRC), etc., has also been assessed 
      with the metagenome-scale models. Thus, modelling the microbial communities 
      combined with advanced experimental design may lead to novel therapeutic 
      approaches like personalized microbiome modelling for treating human disease.

TI  - Antibiotic and antifungal use in pediatric leukemia and lymphoma patients are 
      associated with increasing opportunistic pathogens and decreasing bacteria 
      responsible for activities that enhance colonic defense.

AB  - Due to decreased immunity, both antibiotics and antifungals are regularly used in 
      pediatric hematologic-cancer patients as a means to prevent severe infections and 
      febrile neutropenia. The general effect of antibiotics on the human gut 
      microbiome is profound, yielding decreased diversity and changes in community 
      structure. However, the specific effect on pediatric oncology patients is not 
      well-studied. The effect of antifungal use is even less understood, having been 
      studied only in mouse models. Because the composition of the gut microbiome is 
      associated with regulation of hematopoiesis, immune function and gastrointestinal 
      integrity, changes within the patient gut can have implications for the clinical 
      management of hematologic malignancies. The pediatric population is particularly 
      challenging because the composition of the microbiome is age dependent, with some 
      of the most pronounced changes occurring in the first three years of life. We 
      investigated how antibiotic and antifungal use shapes the taxonomic composition 
      of the stool microbiome in pediatric patients with leukemia and lymphoma, as 
      inferred from both 16S rRNA and metagenome data. Associations with age, 
      antibiotic use and antifungal use were investigated using multiple analysis 
      methods. In addition, multivariable differential abundance was used to identify 
      and assess specific taxa that were associated with multiple variables. Both 
      antibiotics and antifungals were linked to a general decline in diversity in 
      stool samples, which included a decrease in relative abundance in butyrate 
      producers that play a critical role in host gut physiology (e.g., 
      Faecalibacterium, Anaerostipes, Dorea, Blautia),. Furthermore, antifungal use was 
      associated with a significant increase in relative abundance of opportunistic 
      pathogens. Collectively, these findings have important implications for the 
      treatment of leukemia and lymphoma patients. Butyrate is important for 
      gastrointestinal integrity; it inhibits inflammation, reinforces colonic defense, 
      mucosal immunity. and decreases oxidative stress. The routine use of 
      broad-spectrum anti-infectives in pediatric oncology patients could 
      simultaneously contribute to a decline in gastrointestinal integrity and colonic 
      defense while promoting increases in opportunistic pathogens within the patient 
      gut. Because the gut microbiome has been linked to both short-term clinical 
      outcomes, and longer-lasting health effects, systematic characterization of the 
      gut microbiome in pediatric patients during, and beyond, treatment is warranted.

AB  - Mutational processes and signatures that drive early tumorigenesis are centrally 
      important for early cancer prevention. Yet, to date, biomarkers and risk factors 
      for polyps (adenomas) that inordinately and rapidly develop into colon cancer 
      remain poorly defined. Here, we describe surprisingly high mutational profiles 
      through whole-genome sequence (WGS) analysis in 2 of 4 pairs of benign colorectal 
      adenoma tissue samples. Unsupervised hierarchical clustered transcriptomic 
      analysis of a further 7 pairs of adenomas reveals distinct mutational signatures 
      regardless of adenoma size. Transitional single nucleotide substitutions of 
      C:G>T:A predominate in the adenoma mutational spectrum. Strikingly, we observe 
      mutations in the TGF-β pathway and CEA-associated genes in 4 out of 11 adenomas, 
      overlapping with the Wnt pathway. Immunohistochemical labeling reveals a nearly 
      5-fold increase in CEA levels in 23% of adenoma samples with a concomitant loss 
      of TGF-β signaling. We also define a functional role by which the CEA B3 domain 
      interacts with TGFBR1, potentially inactivating the tumor suppressor function of 
      TGF-β signaling. Our study uncovers diverse mutational processes underlying the 
      transition from early adenoma to cancer. This has broad implications for 
      biomarker-driven targeting of CEA/TGF-β in high-risk adenomas and may lead to 
      early detection of aggressive adenoma to CRC progression.

TI  - Gut microbiome meta-analysis reveals dysbiosis is independent of body mass index

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Obesity is a risk factor for colorectal cancer (CRC), accounting for 
      more than 14% of CRC incidence. Microbial dysbiosis and chronic inflammation are 
      common characteristics in both obesity and CRC. Human and murine studies, 
      together, demonstrate the significant impact of the microbiome in governing 
      energy metabolism and CRC development; yet, little is understood about the 
      contribution of the microbiome to development of obesity-associated CRC as 
      compared to individuals who are not obese. DESIGN: In this study, we conducted a 
      meta-analysis using five publicly available stool and tissue-based 16S rRNA and 
      whole genome sequencing (WGS) data sets of CRC microbiome studies. 
      High-resolution analysis was employed for 16S rRNA data, which allowed us to 
      achieve species-level information to compare with WGS. RESULTS: Characterisation 
      of the confounders between studies, 16S rRNA variable region and sequencing 
      method did not reveal any significant effect on alpha diversity in CRC 
      prediction. Both 16S rRNA and WGS were equally variable in their ability to 
      predict CRC. Results from diversity analysis confirmed lower diversity in obese 
      individuals without CRC; however, no universal differences were found in 
      diversity between obese and non-obese individuals with CRC. When examining 
      taxonomic differences, the probability of being classified as CRC did not change 
      significantly in obese individuals for all taxa tested. However, random forest 
      classification was able to distinguish CRC and non-CRC stool when body mass index 
      was added to the model. CONCLUSION: Overall, microbial dysbiosis was not a 
      significant factor in explaining the higher risk of colon cancer among 
      individuals with obesity.

AB  - Current metagenomic species-based colorectal cancer (CRC) microbial biomarkers 
      may confuse diagnosis because the genetic content of different microbial strains, 
      even those belonging to the same species, may differ from 5% to 30%. Here, a 
      total of 7549 non-redundant single nucleotide variants (SNVs) were annotated in 
      25 species from 3 CRC cohorts (n = 249). Then, 22 microbial SNV markers that 
      contributed to distinguishing subjects with CRC from healthy subjects were 
      identified by the random forest algorithm to construct a novel CRC predictive 
      model. Excitingly, the predictive model showed high accuracy both in the training 
      (AUC = 75.35%) and validation cohorts (AUC = 73.08%-88.02%). We further explored 
      the specificity of these SNV markers in a broader background by performing a 
      meta-analysis across 4 metabolic disease cohorts. Among these SNV markers, 3 SNVs 
      that were enriched in CRC patients and located in the genomes of Eubacterium 
      rectale and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii were CRC specific (AUC = 72.51%-94.07%).

AB  - The gut microbiome of vertebrates is capable of numerous biotransformations of 
      bile acids, which are responsible for intestinal lipid digestion and function as 
      key nutrient-signaling molecules. The human liver produces bile acids from 
      cholesterol predominantly in the A/B-<i>cis</i> orientation in which the sterol 
      rings are "kinked", as well as small quantities of A/B-<i>trans</i> oriented 
      "flat" stereoisomers known as "primary allo-bile acids". While the complex 
      multi-step bile acid 7α-dehydroxylation pathway has been well-studied for 
      conversion of "kinked" primary bile acids such as cholic acid (CA) and 
      chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) to deoxycholic acid (DCA) and lithocholic acid 
      (LCA), respectively, the enzymatic basis for the formation of "flat" 
      stereoisomers allo-deoxycholic acid (allo-DCA) and allo-lithocholic acid 
      (allo-LCA) by Firmicutes has remained unsolved for three decades. Here, we 
      present a novel mechanism by which Firmicutes generate the "flat" bile acids 
      allo-DCA and allo-LCA. The BaiA1 was shown to catalyze the final reduction from 
      3-oxo-allo-DCA to allo-DCA and 3-oxo-allo-LCA to allo-LCA. Phylogenetic and 
      metagenomic analyses of human stool samples indicate that BaiP and BaiJ are 
      encoded only in Firmicutes and differ from membrane-associated bile acid 
      5α-reductases recently reported in Bacteroidetes that indirectly generate 
      allo-LCA from 3-oxo-Δ<sup>4</sup>-LCA. We further map the distribution of 
      <i>baiP</i> and <i>baiJ</i> among Firmicutes in human metagenomes, demonstrating 
      an increased abundance of the two genes in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients 
      relative to healthy individuals.

AB  - A new concept is emerging in biomedical sciences: the gut microbiota is a virtual 
      'organ' with endocrine function. Here, we explore the literature pertaining to 
      the role of gut microbial metabolism of endogenous adrenocorticosteroids as a 
      contributing factor in the etiology of essential hypertension. A body of 
      literature demonstrates that bacterial products of glucocorticoid metabolism are 
      absorbed into the portal circulation, and pass through the kidney before 
      excretion into urine. Apparent mineralocorticoid excess (AME) syndrome patients 
      were found to have congenital mutations resulting in non-functional renal 
      11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-2 (11β-HSD2) and severe hypertension often 
      lethal in childhood. 11β-HSD2 acts as a "guardian" enzyme protecting the 
      mineralocorticoid receptor from excess cortisol, preventing sodium and water 
      retention in the normotensive state. Licorice root, whose active ingredient, 
      glycerrhetinic acid (GA), inhibits renal 11β-HSD2, and thereby causes 
      hypertension in some individuals. Bacterially derived glucocorticoid metabolites 
      may cause hypertension in some patients by a similar mechanism. Parallel 
      observations in gut microbiology coupled with screening of endogenous steroids as 
      inhibitors of 11β-HSD2 have implicated particular gut bacteria in essential 
      hypertension through the production of glycerrhetinic acid-like factors (GALFs). 
      A protective role of GALFs produced by gut bacteria in the etiology of colorectal 
      cancer is also explored.

AB  - Disease classification system increasingly incorporates information on pathogenic 
      mechanisms to predict clinical outcomes and response to therapy and intervention. 
      Technological advancements to interrogate omics (genomics, epigenomics, 
      transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, metagenomics, interactomics, etc.) 
      provide widely open opportunities in population-based research. Molecular 
      pathological epidemiology (MPE) represents integrative science of molecular 
      pathology and epidemiology. This unified paradigm requires multidisciplinary 
      collaboration between pathology, epidemiology, biostatistics, bioinformatics, and 
      computational biology. Integration of these fields enables better understanding 
      of etiologic heterogeneity, disease continuum, causal inference, and the impact 
      of environment, diet, lifestyle, host factors (including genetics and immunity), 
      and their interactions on disease evolution. Hence, the Second International MPE 
      Meeting was held in Boston in December 2014, with aims to: (1) develop conceptual 
      and practical frameworks; (2) cultivate and expand opportunities; (3) address 
      challenges; and (4) initiate the effort of specifying guidelines for MPE. The 
      meeting mainly consisted of presentations of method developments and recent data 
      in various malignant neoplasms and tumors (breast, prostate, ovarian and 
      colorectal cancers, renal cell carcinoma, lymphoma, and leukemia), followed by 
      open discussion sessions on challenges and future plans. In particular, we 
      recognized need for efforts to further develop statistical methodologies. This 
      meeting provided an unprecedented opportunity for interdisciplinary 
      collaboration, consistent with the purposes of the Big Data to Knowledge, Genetic 
      Associations and Mechanisms in Oncology, and Precision Medicine Initiative of the 
      US National Institute of Health. The MPE meeting series can help advance 
      transdisciplinary population science and optimize training and education systems 
      for twenty-first century medicine and public health.

AB  - At a simplistic level, colorectal cancer arises from mutations in various 
      proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Aside from genetically inherited 
      factors, environmental, lifestyle, and dietary habits have all been identified as 
      risk agents promoting mutational events leading to the development of colorectal 
      cancer. This "In Focus" presents evidence that the intestinal endogenous 
      bacterial community represents a risk factor for the development of colorectal 
      cancer.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A decade ago, the advancements in the microbiome data sequencing 
      techniques initiated the development of research of the microbiome and its 
      relationship with the host organism. The development of sophisticated 
      bioinformatics and data science tools for the analysis of large amounts of data 
      followed. Since then, the analyzed gut microbiome data, where microbiome is 
      defined as a network of microorganisms inhabiting the human intestinal system, 
      has been associated with several conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome - 
      IBS, colorectal cancer, diabetes, obesity, and metabolic syndrome, and lately in 
      the study of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases as well. This paper aims to 
      provide an understanding of differences between microbial data of individuals who 
      have been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and those who were not by exploiting 
      data science techniques on publicly available data. METHODS: This study examines 
      the relationship between multiple sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune central nervous 
      system disease, and gut microbial community composition, using the samples 
      acquired by 16s rRNA sequencing technique. We have used three different sets of 
      MS samples sequenced during three independent studies (Jangi et al, Nat Commun 
      7:1-11, 2016), (Miyake et al, PLoS ONE 10:0137429, 2015), (McDonald et al, 
      Msystems 3:00031-18, 2018) and this approach strengthens our results. Analyzed 
      sequences were from healthy control and MS groups of sequences. The extracted set 
      of statistically significant bacteria from the (Jangi et al, Nat Commun 7:1-11, 
      2016) dataset samples and their statistically significant predictive functions 
      were used to develop a Random Forest classifier. In total, 8 models based on two 
      criteria: bacteria abundance (at six taxonomic levels) and predictive functions 
      (at two levels), were constructed and evaluated. These include using taxa 
      abundances at different taxonomy levels as well as predictive function analysis 
      at different hierarchical levels of KEGG pathways. RESULTS: The highest accuracy 
      of the classification model was obtained at the genus level of taxonomy (76.82%) 
      and the third hierarchical level of KEGG pathways (70.95%). The second dataset's 
      18 MS samples (Miyake et al, PLoS ONE 10:0137429, 2015) and 18 self-reported 
      healthy samples from the (McDonald et al, Msystems 3:00031-18, 2018) dataset were 
      used to validate the developed classification model. The significance of this 
      step is to show that the model is not overtrained for a specific dataset but can 
      also be used on other independent datasets. Again, the highest classification 
      model accuracy for both validating datasets combined was obtained at the genus 
      level of taxonomy (70.98%) and third hierarchical level of KEGG pathways 
      (67.24%). The accuracy of the independent set remained very relevant. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that the developed classification model 
      provides a good tool that can be used to suggest the presence or absence of MS 
      condition by collecting and analyzing gut microbiome samples. The accuracy of the 
      model can be further increased by using sequencing methods that allow higher taxa 
      resolution (i.e. shotgun metagenomic sequencing).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Compromised intestinal barrier (CIB) has been associated with many 
      enteropathies, including colorectal cancer (CRC) and inflammatory bowel disease 
      (IBD). We hypothesized that CIB could lead to increased host-derived contents 
      including epithelial cells into the gut, change its physio-metabolic properties, 
      and globally alter microbial community and metabolic capacities. RESULTS: 
      Consistently, we found host DNA contents (HDCs), calculated as the percentage of 
      metagenomic sequencing reads mapped to the host genome, were significantly 
      elevated in patients of CRC and Crohn's disease (CD). Consistent with our 
      hypothesis, we found that HDC correlated with microbial- and metabolic-biomarkers 
      of these diseases, contributed significantly to machine-learning models for 
      patient stratification and was consequently ranked as a top contributor. CD 
      patients with treatment could partially reverse the changes of many CD-signature 
      species over time, with reduced HDC and fecal calprotectin (FCP) levels. 
      Strikingly, HDC showed stronger correlations with the reversing changes of the 
      CD-related species than FCP, and contributed greatly in classifying treatment 
      responses, suggesting that it was also a biomarker for effective treatment. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Together, we revealed that association between HDCs and gut 
      dysbiosis, and identified HDC as a novel biomarker from fecal metagenomics for 
      diagnosis and effective treatment of intestinal diseases; our results also 
      suggested that host-derived contents may have greater impact on gut microbiota 
      than previously anticipated.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer, one of the most common malignancies worldwide, is 
      associated with a high mortality rate, mainly caused by metastasis. Comparative 
      metagenome-wide association analyses of healthy individuals and cancer patients 
      suggest a role for the human intestinal microbiota in tumor progression. However, 
      the microbial molecules involved in host-microbe communication are largely 
      unknown, with current studies mainly focusing on short-chain fatty acids and 
      amino acid metabolites as potential mediators. Quorum sensing peptides are not 
      yet considered in this context since their presence in vivo and their ability to 
      affect host cells have not been reported so far. RESULTS: Here, we show that 
      EntF*, a metabolite of the quorum sensing peptide EntF produced by Enterococcus 
      faecium, is naturally present in mice bloodstream. Moreover, by using an 
      orthotopic mouse model, we show that EntF* promotes colorectal cancer metastasis 
      in vivo, with metastatic lesions in liver and lung tissues. In vitro tests 
      suggest that EntF* regulates E-cadherin expression and consequently the 
      epithelial-mesenchymal transition, via the CXCR4 receptor. In addition, 
      alanine-scanning analysis indicates that the first, second, sixth, and tenth 
      amino acid of EntF* are critical for epithelial-mesenchymal transition and tumor 
      metastasis. CONCLUSION: Our work identifies a new class of molecules, quorum 
      sensing peptides, as potential regulators of host-microbe interactions. We prove, 
      for the first time, the presence of a selected quorum sensing peptide metabolite 
      in a mouse model, and we demonstrate its effects on colorectal cancer metastasis. 
      We believe that our work represents a starting point for future investigations on 
      the role of microbiome in colorectal cancer metastasis and for the development of 
      novel bio-therapeutics in other disease areas.

AB  - Instability in the composition of gut bacterial communities (dysbiosis) has been 
      linked to common human intestinal disorders, such as Crohn's disease and 
      colorectal cancer. Here, we show that dysbiosis caused by Nod2 deficiency gives 
      rise to a reversible, communicable risk of colitis and colitis-associated 
      carcinogenesis in mice. Loss of either Nod2 or RIP2 resulted in a proinflammatory 
      microenvironment that enhanced epithelial dysplasia following chemically induced 
      injury. The condition could be improved by treatment with antibiotics or an 
      anti-interleukin-6 receptor-neutralizing antibody. Genotype-dependent disease 
      risk was communicable via maternally transmitted microbiota in both 
      Nod2-deficient and WT hosts. Furthermore, reciprocal microbiota transplantation 
      reduced disease risk in Nod2-deficient mice and led to long-term changes in 
      intestinal microbial communities. Conversely, disease risk was enhanced in WT 
      hosts that were recolonized with dysbiotic fecal microbiota from Nod2-deficient 
      mice. Thus, we demonstrated that licensing of dysbiotic microbiota is a critical 
      component of disease risk. Our results demonstrate that NOD2 has an unexpected 
      role in shaping a protective assembly of gut bacterial communities and suggest 
      that manipulation of dysbiosis is a potential therapeutic approach in the 
      treatment of human intestinal disorders.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Escherichia coli is over-abundant in the gut microbiome of 
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease [IBD]. Here, we aimed to identify 
      IBD-specific genomic functions of diverse E. coli lineages. METHODS: We 
      investigated E. coli genomes from patients with ulcerative colitis [UC], Crohn's 
      disease [CD] or a pouch, and healthy subjects. The majority of genomes were 
      reconstructed from metagenomic samples, including newly sequenced faecal 
      metagenomes. Clinical metadata were collected. Functional analysis at the gene 
      and mutation level were performed and integrated with IBD phenotypes and 
      biomarkers. RESULTS: Overall, 530 E. coli genomes were analysed. The E. coli B2 
      lineage was more prevalent in UC compared with other IBD phenotypes. Genomic 
      metabolic capacities varied across E. coli lineages and IBD phenotypes. Host 
      mucin utilisation enzymes were present in a single lineage and depleted in 
      patients with a pouch, whereas those involved in inulin hydrolysis were enriched 
      in patients with a pouch. E. coli strains from patients with UC were twice as 
      likely to encode the genotoxic molecule colibactin than strains from patients 
      with CD or a pouch. Strikingly, patients with a pouch showed the highest inferred 
      E. coli growth rates, even in the presence of antibiotics. Faecal calprotectin 
      did not correlate with the relative abundance of E. coli. Finally, we identified 
      multiple IBD-specific non-synonymous mutations in E. coli genes encoding for 
      bacterial cell envelope components. CONCLUSIONS: Comparative genomics indicates 
      that E. coli is a commensal species adapted to the overactive mucosal immune 
      milieu in IBD, rather than causing it. Our results reveal mutations that may lead 
      to attenuated antigenicity in some E. coli strains.

TI  - Mutated CEACAMs Disrupt Transforming Growth Factor Beta Signaling and Alter the 
      Intestinal Microbiome to Promote Colorectal Carcinogenesis.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: We studied interactions among proteins of the carcinoembryonic 
      antigen-related cell adhesion molecule (CEACAM) family, which interact with 
      microbes, and transforming growth factor beta (TGFB) signaling pathway, which is 
      often altered in colorectal cancer cells. We investigated mechanisms by which 
      CEACAM proteins inhibit TGFB signaling and alter the intestinal microbiome to 
      promote colorectal carcinogenesis. METHODS: We collected data on DNA sequences, 
      messenger RNA expression levels, and patient survival times from 456 colorectal 
      adenocarcinoma cases, and a separate set of 594 samples of colorectal 
      adenocarcinomas, in The Cancer Genome Atlas. We performed shotgun metagenomic 
      sequencing analyses of feces from wild-type mice and mice with defects in TGFB 
      signaling (Sptbn1(+/-) and Smad4(+/-)/Sptbn1(+/-)) to identify changes in 
      microbiota composition before development of colon tumors. CEACAM protein and its 
      mutants were overexpressed in SW480 and HCT116 colorectal cancer cell lines, 
      which were analyzed by immunoblotting and proliferation and colony formation 
      assays. RESULTS: In colorectal adenocarcinomas, high expression levels of genes 
      encoding CEACAM proteins, especially CEACAM5, were associated with reduced 
      survival times of patients. There was an inverse correlation between expression 
      of CEACAM genes and expression of TGFB pathway genes (TGFBR1, TGFBR2, and SMAD3). 
      In colorectal adenocarcinomas, we also found an inverse correlation between 
      expression of genes in the TGFB signaling pathway and genes that regulate stem 
      cell features of cells. We found mutations encoding L640I and A643T in the B3 
      domain of human CEACAM5 in colorectal adenocarcinomas; structural studies 
      indicated that these mutations would alter the interaction between CEACAM5 and 
      TGFBR1. Overexpression of these mutants in SW480 and HCT116 colorectal cancer 
      cell lines increased their anchorage-independent growth and inhibited TGFB 
      signaling to a greater extent than overexpression of wild-type CEACAM5, 
      indicating that they are gain-of-function mutations. Compared with feces from 
      wild-type mice, feces from mice with defects in TGFB signaling had increased 
      abundance of bacterial species that have been associated with the development of 
      colon tumors, including Clostridium septicum, and decreased amounts of beneficial 
      bacteria, such as Bacteroides vulgatus and Parabacteroides distasonis. 
      CONCLUSION: We found expression of CEACAMs and genes that regulate stem cell 
      features of cells to be increased in colorectal adenocarcinomas and inversely 
      correlated with expression of TGFB pathway genes. We found colorectal 
      adenocarcinomas to express mutant forms of CEACAM5 that inhibit TGFB signaling 
      and increase proliferation and colony formation. We propose that CEACAM proteins 
      disrupt TGFB signaling, which alters the composition of the intestinal microbiome 
      to promote colorectal carcinogenesis.

TI  - Lactobacillus plantarum HNU082 alleviates dextran sulfate sodium-induced 
      ulcerative colitis in mice through regulating gut microbiome.
PG  - 10171-10185
LID - 10.1039/d2fo02303b [doi]
AB  - Probiotics have shown good efficacy in the prevention of ulcerative colitis (UC), 
      but the specific mechanism remains unclear. Therefore, shotgun metagenomic and 
      transcriptome analyses were performed to explore the preventive effect of a 
      potential probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum HNU082 (Lp082) on UC and its specific 
      mechanism. The results showed that Lp082 intervention ameliorated dextran sulfate 
      sodium (DSS)-induced UC in mice, which was manifested in the increase in body 
      weight, water intake, food intake, and colon length and the decrease in the DAI 
      index, immune organ index, inflammatory factors and histopathological scores 
      after Lp082 intake. The mechanism is deeply studied and it is discovered that 
      Lp082 improves the intestinal mucosal barrier by co-optimizing biological 
      barriers, chemical barriers, mechanical barriers, and immune barriers. 
      Specifically, Lp082 improved the biological barrier by increasing the diversity, 
      optimizing the species composition and the structure of the gut microbiota, 
      increasing bacteria producing short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and activating 
      microbial metabolic pathways producing SCFAs so as to enhance the content of 
      SCFAs. Lp082 optimized the chemical barrier by decreasing the mRNA expression of 
      ICAM-1 and VCAM and by increasing the content of goblet cells and the mRNA 
      expression and immunofluorescent protein content of mucin2. Lp082 ameliorated the 
      mechanical barrier by decreasing the mRNA expression of claudin-1 and claudin-2, 
      and by increasing the mRNA expression of ZO-1 and ZO-2 and the immunofluorescent 
      protein content of ZO-1. Lp082 also optimized the immune barrier by increasing 
      the mRNA expression of IL-10, TGF-β1, and TGF-β2 and by decreasing the mRNA 
      expression and protein contents of IL-6, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and 
      myeloperoxidase (MPO). In addition, Lp082 can also regulate the metabolic 
      pathways of inflammation and disease in mice, and notably, Lp082 inhibits the 
      NF-κB signaling pathway by inhibiting NF-κB signaling molecules to alleviate UC. 
      In conclusion, improving gut microbiota dysbiosis, protecting the intestinal 
      mucosal barrier, regulating inflammatory and disease pathways, and affecting 
      neutrophil infiltration are the potential mechanisms of probiotic Lp082 in 
      alleviating UC. Our study enriches the mechanism and provides a new prospect for 
      Lactobacillus plantarum HNU082 in the prevention of colitis, provides support for 
      the development of probiotic-based microbial products as an alternative 
      prevention strategy for UC, and provides guidance for the future probiotic 
      prevention of human colitis.

      β-Deficient Colon Cancer.

AB  - Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most treatable cancers, with a 5-year 
      survival rate of ~64%, yet over 50,000 deaths occur yearly in the United States. 
      In 15% of cases, deficiency in mismatch repair leads to null mutations in 
      transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) type II receptor, yet genotype alone is not 
      responsible for tumorigenesis. Previous work in mice shows that disruptions in 
      TGF-β signaling combined with Helicobacter hepaticus cause tumorigenesis, 
      indicating a synergistic effect between genotype and microbial environment. Here, 
      we examine functional shifts in the gut microbiome in CRC using integrated -omics 
      approaches to untangle the role of host genotype, inflammation, and microbial 
      ecology. We profile the gut microbiome of 40 mice with/without deficiency in 
      TGF-β signaling from a Smad3 (mothers against decapentaplegic homolog-3) knockout 
      and with/without inoculation with H. hepaticus. Clear functional differences in 
      the microbiome tied to specific bacterial species emerge from four pathways 
      related to human colon cancer: lipopolysaccharide (LPS) production, polyamine 
      synthesis, butyrate metabolism, and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). 
      Specifically, an increase in Mucispirillum schaedleri drives LPS production, 
      which is associated with an inflammatory response. We observe a commensurate 
      decrease in butyrate production from Lachnospiraceae bacterium A4, which could 
      promote tumor formation. H. hepaticus causes an increase in OXPHOS that may 
      increase DNA-damaging free radicals. Finally, multiple bacterial species increase 
      polyamines that are associated with colon cancer, implicating not just diet but 
      also the microbiome in polyamine levels. These insights into cross talk between 
      the microbiome, host genotype, and inflammation could promote the development of 
      diagnostics and therapies for CRC. IMPORTANCE Most research on the gut microbiome 
      in colon cancer focuses on taxonomic changes at the genus level using 16S rRNA 
      gene sequencing. Here, we develop a new methodology to integrate DNA and RNA data 
      sets to examine functional shifts at the species level that are important to 
      tumor development. We uncover several metabolic pathways in the microbiome that, 
      when perturbed by host genetics and H. hepaticus inoculation, contribute to colon 
      cancer. The work presented here lays a foundation for improved bioinformatics 
      methodologies to closely examine the cross talk between specific organisms and 
      the host, important for the development of diagnostics and pre/probiotic 
      treatment.

AB  - Metagenomic sequencing methods provide considerable genomic information regarding 
      human microbiomes, enabling us to discover and understand microbial diseases. 
      Compositional differences have been reported between patients and healthy people, 
      which could be used in the diagnosis of patients. Despite significant progress in 
      this regard, the accuracy of these tools needs to be improved for applications in 
      diagnostics and therapeutics. MDL4Microbiome, the method developed herein, 
      demonstrated high accuracy in predicting disease status by using various features 
      from metagenome sequences and a multimodal deep learning model. We propose 
      combining three different features, i.e., conventional taxonomic profiles, 
      genome-level relative abundance, and metabolic functional characteristics, to 
      enhance classification accuracy. This deep learning model enabled the 
      construction of a classifier that combines these various modalities encoded in 
      the human microbiome. We achieved accuracies of 0.98, 0.76, 0.84, and 0.97 for 
      predicting patients with inflammatory bowel disease, type 2 diabetes, liver 
      cirrhosis, and colorectal cancer, respectively; these are comparable or higher 
      than classical machine learning methods. A deeper analysis was also performed on 
      the resulting sets of selected features to understand the contribution of their 
      different characteristics. MDL4Microbiome is a classifier with higher or 
      comparable accuracy compared with other machine learning methods, which offers 
      perspectives on feature generation with metagenome sequences in deep learning 
      models and their advantages in the classification of host disease status.

TI  - Intestinal steroid profiles and microbiota composition in colitic mice.
PG  - 159-66
LID - 10.4161/gmic.2.3.16104 [doi]
AB  - Reduced gut microbiota diversity in conjunction with a bloom of few bacterial 
      species is a common feature in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. 
      However, the environmental changes caused by inflammation and their possible 
      impact on the microbiota are largely unknown. Since IBD is associated with an 
      impaired intestinal steroid metabolism, we hypothesized that changes in 
      intestinal steroid and particularly bile acid (BA) concentrations affect 
      microbial communities. We used Interleukin-10 deficient (IL-10-/-) mice as a 
      model for chronic gut inflammation. Healthy wild-type mice served as controls. In 
      these animals, intestinal steroid concentrations and gut microbial diversity were 
      analyzed at 24 weeks of age. The IL 10-/- mice developed moderate inflammation in 
      cecum and colon and colorectal tumor formation was observed in 55 % of the 
      animals. Compared to the healthy conditions, gut inflammation was associated with 
      higher intestinal cholesterol and cholic acid concentrations and a reduced 
      microbial diversity. The latter was accompanied by a proliferation of 
      Robinsoniella peoriensis, Clostridium innocuum, Escherichia coli, and 
      Enterococcus gallinarum. All these species proved to be highly bile acid 
      resistant. We concluded that chronic colitis in IL-10-/- mice is associated with 
      changes in intestinal steroid profiles. These changes may be due to alterations 
      in gut microbiota composition or vice versa. Whether the bacterial sterol and 
      bile acid metabolism is implicated in colitis and colorectal carcinoma etiology 
      remains to be clarified.

LID - 10.1080/01635581.2011.552157 [doi]
AB  - Polyphenols may play an important role in colon cancer prevention. After entering 
      the colon, they are subjected to metabolism by the human gut microbiota. The 
      objective of the present study was to analyze the impact of selected intestinal 
      metabolites on modulation of enzymes involved in detoxification and inflammation 
      in human adenoma cells LT97. LT97 cells were incubated with 
      3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (ES) and 3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-propionic acid 
      (PS), metabolites of quercetin and chlorogenic acid/caffeic acid, respectively. 
      The effect on cell number was analyzed using 4'- 
      6-diamino-2-phenylindole-dihydrochloride (DAPI)-staining. Modulation of 
      glutathione S-transferase T2 (GSTT2) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) was measured by 
      real-time PCR and Western blot. Comet assay was performed to assess the impact on 
      DNA damage caused by the GSTT2 substrate cumene hydroperoxide (CumOOH). 
      Polyphenol metabolites did not affect cell number but significantly upregulated 
      GSTT2 expression and decreased COX-2. The latter was confirmed via Western blot. 
      CumOOH-induced DNA damage was significantly reduced compared to the control. An 
      upregulation of GSTT2 and downregulation of COX-2 could possibly contribute to 
      the chemopreventive potential of polyphenols after degradation in the gut. 
      Working with polyphenol metabolites is an important prerequisite to better 
      understand the in vivo effects of pure polyphenols.

TI  - Whole genome sequencing reveals potential targets for therapy in patients with 
      refractory KRAS mutated metastatic colorectal cancer.
PG  - 36
LID - 10.1186/1755-8794-7-36 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The outcome of patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma (mCRC) 
      following first line therapy is poor, with median survival of less than one year. 
      The purpose of this study was to identify candidate therapeutically targetable 
      somatic events in mCRC patient samples by whole genome sequencing (WGS), so as to 
      obtain targeted treatment strategies for individual patients. METHODS: Four 
      patients were recruited, all of whom had received > 2 prior therapy regimens. 
      Percutaneous needle biopsies of metastases were performed with whole blood 
      collection for the extraction of constitutional DNA. One tumor was not included 
      in this study as the quality of tumor tissue was not sufficient for further 
      analysis. WGS was performed using Illumina paired end chemistry on HiSeq2000 
      sequencing systems, which yielded coverage of greater than 30X for all samples. 
      NGS data were processed and analyzed to detect somatic genomic alterations 
      including point mutations, indels, copy number alterations, translocations and 
      rearrangements. RESULTS: All 3 tumor samples had KRAS mutations, while 2 tumors 
      contained mutations in the APC gene and the PIK3CA gene. Although we did not 
      identify a TCF7L2-VTI1A translocation, we did detect a TCF7L2 mutation in one 
      tumor. Among the other interesting mutated genes was INPPL1, an important gene 
      involved in PI3 kinase signaling. Functional studies demonstrated that inhibition 
      of INPPL1 reduced growth of CRC cells, suggesting that INPPL1 may promote growth 
      in CRC. CONCLUSIONS: Our study further supports potential molecularly defined 
      therapeutic contexts that might provide insights into treatment strategies for 
      refractory mCRC. New insights into the role of INPPL1 in colon tumor cell growth 
      have also been identified. Continued development of appropriate targeted agents 
      towards specific events may be warranted to help improve outcomes in CRC.

TI  - Discovery of Gut Bacteria Specific to Alzheimer's Associated Diseases is a Clue 
      to Understanding Disease Etiology: Meta-Analysis of Population-Based Data on 
      Human Gut Metagenomics and Metabolomics.
PG  - 319-355
LID - 10.3233/JAD-190873 [doi]
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD)-associated sequence (ADAS) of cultured fecal bacteria 
      was discovered in human gut targeted screening. This study provides important 
      information to expand our current understanding of the structure/activity 
      relationship of ADAS and putative inhibitors/activators that are potentially 
      involved in ADAS appearance/disappearance. The NCBI database analysis revealed 
      that ADAS presents at a large proportion in American Indian Oklahoman (C&A) with 
      a high prevalence of obesity/diabetes and in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients 
      from the US and China. An Oklahoman non-native group (NNI) showed no ADAS. 
      Comparison of two large US populations reveals that ADAS is more frequent in 
      individuals aged ≥66 and in females. Prevalence and levels of fecal metabolites 
      are altered in the C&A and CRC groups versus controls. Biogenic amines 
      (histamine, tryptamine, tyramine, phenylethylamine, cadaverine, putrescine, 
      agmatine, spermidine) that present in food and are produced by gut microbiota are 
      significantly higher in C&A (e.g., histamine/histidine 95-fold) versus NNI 
      (histamine/histidine 16-fold). The majority of these bio-amines are cytotoxic at 
      concentrations found in food. Inositol phosphate signaling implicated in AD is 
      altered in C&A and CRC. Tryptamine stimulated accumulation of inositol phosphate. 
      The seizure-eliciting tryptamine induced cytoplasmic vacuolization and 
      vesiculation with cell fragmentation. Present additions of ADAS-carriers at 
      different ages including infants led to an ADAS-comprising human sample size of 
      2,830 from 27 studies from four continents (North America, Australia, Asia, 
      Europe). Levels of food-derived monoamine oxidase inhibitors and anti-bacterial 
      compounds, the potential modulators of ADAS-bacteria growth and biogenic amine 
      production, were altered in C&A versus NNI. ADAS is attributable to potentially 
      modifiable risk factors of AD associated diseases.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the effects of the programmed death-1/programmed 
      death-ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) signaling pathway on the intestinal flora in patients 
      with colorectal cancer (CRC). METHODS: A total of 30 CRC patients treated with 
      PD-1 monoclonal antibody therapy in the Oncology Department of our hospital from 
      January 2018 to January 2019, and another 30 patients treated with routine 
      non-immune therapy were enrolled. The feces specimens were collected for 
      sequencing, the CRC model was established, and the 16S rRNA gene sequences in 
      intestinal flora in feces specimens of mice were analyzed. RESULTS: The 3-month 
      progression-free survival could not be predicted through the gene count or 
      abundance of metagenomic species (MGS) in intestinal microflora of patients. The 
      gene count or MGS abundance was related to the clinical progression-free 
      response. There were abundant unclassified Escherichia coli, s_lactobacillus and 
      s_unclassified parasutterella in patients treated with PD-1. The reflection curve 
      of microbiota had an obvious difference in richness (Chao1), but had no apparent 
      difference in diversity (Shannon). CONCLUSION: The PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway 
      can regulate the metabolic activity of intestinal flora, thereby promoting immune 
      surveillance of tumors.

TI  - The role of vitamin D in reducing gastrointestinal disease risk and assessment of 
      individual dietary intake needs: Focus on genetic and genomic technologies.
PG  - 119-33
LID - 10.1002/mnfr.201500243 [doi]
AB  - With the endogenous formation of vitamin D being significantly curtailed because 
      of public awareness of skin cancer dangers, attention is turning to dietary 
      sources. Cumulative evidence has implicated vitamin D deficiency in increasing 
      susceptibility to various gastrointestinal disorders, including colorectal 
      cancer, inflammatory bowel diseases, diverticulitis, and irritable bowel 
      syndrome. There is also reason to suggest adjunct vitamin D therapy for such 
      diseases. Although there is justification for increasing vitamin D intake 
      overall, optimal intakes will vary among individuals. Genomic technologies have 
      revealed several hundreds of genes associated with vitamin D actions. The nature 
      of these genes emphasizes the potentially negative implications of modulating 
      vitamin D intakes in the absence of complementary human genetic and genomic data, 
      including information on the gut microbiome. However, we are not yet in a 
      position to apply this information. Genomic data (transcriptomics, metabolomics, 
      proteomics, and metagenomics) could provide evidence that vitamin D sufficiency 
      has been achieved. We suggest that there is an increasingly strong case for 
      considering the more widespread use of vitamin D fortified foods and/or dietary 
      supplements to benefit gastrointestinal health. However, intake levels might 
      beneficially be informed by personalized genetic and genomic information, for 
      optimal disease prevention and maintenance of remission.

TI  - Association of Flavonifractor plautii, a Flavonoid-Degrading Bacterium, with the 
      Gut Microbiome of Colorectal Cancer Patients in India.
LID - 10.1128/mSystems.00438-19 [doi]
LID - e00438-19
AB  - Recently, dysbiosis in the human gut microbiome and shifts in the relative 
      abundances of several bacterial species have been recognized as important factors 
      in colorectal cancer (CRC). However, these studies have been carried out mainly 
      in developed countries where CRC has a high incidence, and it is unclear whether 
      the host-microbiome relationships deduced from these studies can be generalized 
      to the global population. To test if the documented associations between the 
      microbiome and CRC are conserved in a distinct context, we performed metagenomic 
      and metabolomic association studies on fecal samples from 30 CRC patients and 30 
      healthy controls from two different locations in India, followed by a comparison 
      of CRC data available from other populations. We confirmed the association of 
      Bacteroides and other bacterial taxa with CRC that have been previously reported 
      in other studies. However, the association of CRC with Flavonifractor plautii in 
      Indian patients emerged as a novel finding. The plausible role of F. plautii 
      appears to be linked with the degradation of beneficial anticarcinogenic 
      flavonoids, which was also found to be significantly correlated with the enzymes 
      and modules involved in flavonoid degradation within Indian CRC samples. Thus, we 
      hypothesize that the degradation of beneficial flavonoids might be playing a role 
      in cancer progression within this Indian cohort. We also identified 20 potential 
      microbial taxonomic markers and 33 potential microbial gene markers that 
      discriminate the Indian CRC from healthy microbiomes with high accuracy based on 
      machine learning approaches.IMPORTANCE This study provides novel insights on the 
      CRC-associated microbiome of a unique cohort in India, reveals the potential role 
      of a new bacterium in CRC, and identifies cohort-specific biomarkers, which can 
      potentially be used in noninvasive diagnosis of CRC. The study gains additional 
      significance, as India is among the countries with a very low incidence of CRC, 
      and the diet and lifestyle in India have been associated with a distinct gut 
      microbiome in healthy Indians compared to other global populations. Thus, in this 
      study, we hypothesize a unique relationship between CRC and the gut microbiome in 
      an Indian population.

TI  - The interaction of short-chain fatty acids with adipose tissue: relevance for 
      prevention of type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 433-7
LID - 10.3920/BM2010.0028 [doi]
AB  - Short chain fatty acids (SCFA) are the main bacterial metabolites of colonic 
      fermentation processes. The physiological relevance of the SCFA for the host 
      outside the gastrointestinal tract is getting increased attention. In this review 
      we will focus on the effect of SCFA on inflammation processes in the host in 
      relation to insulin resistance. Obesity has been associated with a 
      pro-inflammatory state of the adipose tissue that is associated with whole body 
      insulin resistance leading to type 2 diabetes. Recently, two G protein-coupled 
      receptors (GPCR) for SCFA, GPCR 41 and GPCR43, were described that are mainly 
      expressed by immune cells but also by adipose tissue. Propionate can induce the 
      satiety hormone leptin and reduce expression of inflammatory cytokines and 
      chemokines indicating that SCFA have anti-inflammatory effects in human adipose 
      tissue. In addition, in human nutritional experiments we observed that whole 
      grain products could counteract a glucose-induced tumour necrosis factor α and 
      interleukin-6 increase which was associated with increased plasma butyrate 
      concentrations. This suggests that dietary fibre can produce a SCFA profile that 
      could have anti-inflammatory effects in the body. The physiological relevance of 
      these observations especially in relation to obesity-associated inflammation and 
      insulin resistance is discussed.

      where are we now in the era of the next generation proteomics?
PG  - 13466-2476
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v20.i37.13466 [doi]
AB  - Recent advances in genomic medicine have opened up the possibility of tailored 
      medicine that may eventually replace traditional "one-size-fits all" approaches 
      to the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In addition to exploring 
      the interactions between hosts and microbes, referred to as the microbiome, a 
      variety of strategies that can be tailored to an individual in the coming era of 
      personalized medicine in the treatment of IBD are being investigated. These 
      include prompt genomic screening of patients at risk of developing IBD, the 
      utility of molecular discrimination of IBD subtypes among patients diagnosed with 
      IBD, and the discovery of proteome biomarkers to diagnose or predict cancer 
      risks. Host genetic factors influence the etiology of IBD, as do microbial 
      ecosystems in the human bowel, which are not uniform, but instead represent many 
      different microhabitats that can be influenced by diet and might affect processes 
      essential to bowel metabolism. Further advances in basic research regarding 
      intestinal inflammation may reveal new insights into the role of inflammatory 
      mediators, referred to as the inflammasome, and the macromolecular complex of 
      metabolites formed by intestinal bacteria. Collectively, knowledge of the 
      inflammasome and metagenomics will lead to the development of biomarkers for IBD 
      that target specific pathogenic mechanisms involved in the spontaneous progress 
      of IBD. In this review article, our recent results regarding the discovery of 
      potential proteomic biomarkers using a label-free quantification technique are 
      introduced and on-going projects contributing to either the discrimination of IBD 
      subtypes or to the prediction of cancer risks are accompanied by updated 
      information from IBD biomarker research.

TI  - Gut bacteria responding to dietary change encode sialidases that exhibit 
      preference for red meat-associated carbohydrates.

AB  - Dietary habits have been associated with alterations of the human gut resident 
      microorganisms contributing to obesity, diabetes and cancer(1). In Western diets, 
      red meat is a frequently eaten food(2), but long-term consumption has been 
      associated with increased risk of disease(3,4). Red meat is enriched in 
      N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) that cannot be synthesized by humans(5). 
      However, consumption can cause Neu5Gc incorporation into cell surface glycans(6), 
      especially in carcinomas(4,7). As a consequence, an inflammatory response is 
      triggered when Neu5Gc-containing glycans encounter circulating anti-Neu5Gc 
      antibodies(8,9). Although bacteria can use free sialic acids as a nutrient 
      source(10-12), it is currently unknown if gut microorganisms contribute to 
      releasing Neu5Gc from food. We found that a Neu5Gc-rich diet induces changes in 
      the gut microbiota, with Bacteroidales and Clostridiales responding the most. 
      Genome assembling of mouse and human shotgun metagenomic sequencing identified 
      bacterial sialidases with previously unobserved substrate preference for 
      Neu5Gc-containing glycans. X-ray crystallography revealed key amino acids 
      potentially contributing to substrate preference. Additionally, we verified that 
      mouse and human sialidases were able to release Neu5Gc from red meat. The release 
      of Neu5Gc from red meat using bacterial sialidases could reduce the risk of 
      inflammatory diseases associated with red meat consumption, including colorectal 
      cancer(4) and atherosclerosis(13).

TI  - Monitoring intestinal microbiota profile: a promising method for the ultraearly 
      detection of colorectal cancer.
PG  - 670-2
LID - 10.1016/j.mehy.2011.01.028 [doi]
AB  - Colorectal cancer is one of the most common cancers and is very hard to be 
      detected at an ultraearly stage because of lack of valuable predicating methods 
      that often lead to treatment failure. Intestinal microbiota has long been 
      considered to implicate in colorectal cancer pathology; and many recent reports 
      point out a close linkage between the intestinal bacteria and the genesis of the 
      tumor. Present studies indicate that the structure and characteristics of the 
      intestinal microbiota are significantly altered in colorectal cancer, 
      precancerous lesion, and high risk population compared with healthy controls and 
      low risk population. Based on the current studies and theories, we postulate 
      monitoring the intestinal bacterial profile by the molecular methods that could 
      fulfill the ultraearly prediction about the degree of the risk developing into 
      colorectal cancer. Further population-based epidemiological study is useful to 
      reveal the characteristics of the intestinal microbiota in ultraearly colorectal 
      cancer, which might provide some novel prophylactic and therapeutic strategies 
      for the colorectal cancer.

TI  - Metathramycin, a new bioactive aureolic acid discovered by heterologous 
      expression of a metagenome derived biosynthetic pathway.
PG  - 556-567
LID - 10.1039/d0cb00228c [doi]
AB  - Bacterial natural products have been a rich source of bioactive compounds for 
      drug development, and advances in DNA sequencing, informatics and molecular 
      biology have opened new avenues for their discovery. Here, we describe the 
      isolation of an aureolic acid biosynthetic gene cluster from a metagenome library 
      derived from a New Zealand soil sample. Heterologous expression of this pathway 
      in Streptomyces albus resulted in the production and isolation of two new 
      aureolic acid compounds, one of which (metathramycin, 6) possesses potent 
      bioactivity against a human colon carcinoma cell line (HCT-116, IC(50) = 14.6 
      nM). As metathramycin was a minor constituent of the fermentation extract, its 
      discovery relied on a combination of approaches including bioactivity guided 
      fractionation, MS/MS characterisation and pathway engineering. This study not 
      only demonstrates the presence of previously uncharacterised aureolic acids in 
      the environment, but also the value of an integrated natural product discovery 
      approach which may be generally applicable to low abundance bioactive 
      metabolites.

TI  - Capturing One of the Human Gut Microbiome's Most Wanted: Reconstructing the

      Sequence Data.

AB  - The role of the microbiome in health and disease is attracting great attention, 
      yet we still know little about some of the most prevalent microorganisms inside 
      our bodies. Several years ago, Human Microbiome Project (HMP) researchers 
      generated a list of "most wanted" taxa: bacteria both prevalent among healthy 
      volunteers and distantly related to any sequenced organisms. Unfortunately, the 
      challenge of assembling high-quality genomes from a tangle of metagenomic reads 
      has slowed progress in learning about these uncultured bacteria. Here, we 
      describe how recent advances in sequencing and analysis allowed us to assemble 
      "most wanted" genomes from metagenomic data collected from four stool samples. 
      Using a combination of both de novo and guided assembly methods, we assembled and 
      binned over 100 genomes from an initial data set of over 1,300 Gbp. One of these 
      genome bins, which met HMP's criteria for a "most wanted" taxa, contained three 
      essentially complete genomes belonging to a previously uncultivated species. This 
      species is most closely related to Eubacterium desmolans and the clostridial 
      cluster IV/Clostridium leptum subgroup species Butyricicoccus pullicaecorum 
      (71-76% average nucleotide identity). Gene function analysis indicates that the 
      species is an obligate anaerobe, forms spores, and produces the anti-inflammatory 
      short-chain fatty acids acetate and butyrate. It also appears to take up 
      metabolically costly molecules such as cobalamin, methionine, and branch-chained 
      amino acids from the environment, and to lack virulence genes. Thus, the evidence 
      is consistent with a secondary degrader that occupies a host-dependent, 
      nutrient-scavenging niche within the gut; its ability to produce butyrate, which 
      is thought to play an anti-inflammatory role, makes it intriguing for the study 
      of diseases such as colon cancer and inflammatory bowel disease. In conclusion, 
      we have assembled essentially complete genomes from stool metagenomic data, 
      yielding valuable information about uncultured organisms' metabolic and ecologic 
      niches, factors that may be required to successfully culture these bacteria, and 
      their role in maintaining health and causing disease.

AB  - Evaluating the relationship between the human gut microbiome and disease requires 
      computing reliable statistical associations. Here, using millions of different 
      association modeling strategies, we evaluated the consistency-or robustness-of 
      microbiome-based disease indicators for 6 prevalent and well-studied phenotypes 
      (across 15 public cohorts and 2,343 individuals). We were able to discriminate 
      between analytically robust versus nonrobust results. In many cases, different 
      models yielded contradictory associations for the same taxon-disease pairing, 
      some showing positive correlations and others negative. When querying a subset of 
      581 microbe-disease associations that have been previously reported in the 
      literature, 1 out of 3 taxa demonstrated substantial inconsistency in association 
      sign. Notably, >90% of published findings for type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 
      diabetes (T2D) were particularly nonrobust in this regard. We additionally 
      quantified how potential confounders-sequencing depth, glucose levels, 
      cholesterol, and body mass index, for example-influenced associations, analyzing 
      how these variables affect the ostensible correlation between Faecalibacterium 
      prausnitzii abundance and a healthy gut. Overall, we propose our approach as a 
      method to maximize confidence when prioritizing findings that emerge from 
      microbiome association studies.

TI  - A phylogenomic view of ecological specialization in the Lachnospiraceae, a family 
      of digestive tract-associated bacteria.
PG  - 703-13
LID - 10.1093/gbe/evu050 [doi]
AB  - Several bacterial families are known to be highly abundant within the human 
      microbiome, but their ecological roles and evolutionary histories have yet to be 
      investigated in depth. One such family, Lachnospiraceae (phylum Firmicutes, class 
      Clostridia) is abundant in the digestive tracts of many mammals and relatively 
      rare elsewhere. Members of this family have been linked to obesity and protection 
      from colon cancer in humans, mainly due to the association of many species within 
      the group with the production of butyric acid, a substance that is important for 
      both microbial and host epithelial cell growth. We examined the genomes of 30 
      Lachnospiraceae isolates to better understand the origin of butyric acid 
      capabilities and other ecological adaptations within this group. Butyric acid 
      production-related genes were detected in fewer than half of the examined genomes 
      with the distribution of this function likely arising in part from lateral gene 
      transfer (LGT). An investigation of environment-specific functional signatures 
      indicated that human gut-associated Lachnospiraceae possess genes for endospore 
      formation, whereas other members of this family lack key sporulation-associated 
      genes, an observation supported by analysis of metagenomes from the human gut, 
      oral cavity, and bovine rumen. Our analysis demonstrates that adaptation to an 
      ecological niche and acquisition of defining functional roles within a microbiome 
      can arise through a combination of both habitat-specific gene loss and LGT.

AB  - Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignant diseases. Generally, 
      stoma construction is performed following surgery for the resection of the 
      primary tumor in patients with CRC. The association of CRC with the gut 
      microbiota has been widely reported, and the gut microbiota is known to play an 
      important role in the carcinogenesis, progression, and treatment of CRC. In this 
      study, we compared the microbiota of patients with CRC between with and without a 
      stoma using fecal metagenomic sequencing data from SCRUM-Japan MONSTAR-SCREEN, a 
      joint industry-academia cancer research project in Japan. We found that the 
      composition of anaerobes was reduced in patients with a stoma. In particular, the 
      abundance of Alistipes, Akkermansia, Intestinimonas, and methane-producing 
      archaea decreased. We also compared gene function (e.g., KEGG Orthology and KEGG 
      pathway) and found that gene function for methane and short-chain fatty acids 
      (SCFAs) production was underrepresented in patients with a stoma. Furthermore, a 
      stoma decreased Shannon diversity based on taxonomic composition but increased 
      that of the KEGG pathway. These results suggest that the feces of patients with a 
      stoma have a reduced abundance of favorable microbes for cancer immunotherapy. In 
      conclusion, we showed that a stoma alters the taxonomic and functional profiles 
      in feces and may be a confounding factor in fecal microbiota analysis.

TI  - Isocytosine deaminase Vcz as a novel tool for the prodrug cancer therapy.
PG  - 197
LID - 10.1186/s12885-019-5409-7 [doi]
LID - 197
AB  - BACKGROUND: The cytosine deaminase (CD)/5-fluorocytosine (5-FC) system is among 
      the best explored enzyme/prodrug systems in the field of the suicide gene 
      therapy. Recently, by the screening of the environmental metagenomic libraries we 
      identified a novel isocytosine deaminase (ICD), termed Vcz, which is able of 
      specifically converting a prodrug 5-fluoroisocytosine (5-FIC) into toxic drug 
      5-fluorouracil (5-FU). The aim of this study is to test the applicability of the 
      ICD Vcz / 5-FIC pair as a potential suicide gene therapy tool. METHODS: 
      Vcz-expressing human glioblastoma U87 and epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma 
      Caco-2 cells were treated with 5-FIC, and the Vcz-mediated cytotoxicity was 
      evaluated by performing an MTT assay. In order to examine anti-tumor effects of 
      the Vcz/5-FIC system in vivo, murine bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells 
      (MSC) were transduced with the Vcz-coding lentivirus and co-injected with 5-FIC 
      or control reagents into subcutaneous GL261 tumors evoked in C57/BL6 mice. 
      RESULTS: 5-FIC alone showed no significant toxic effects on U87 and Caco-2 cells 
      at 100 μM concentration, whereas the number of cells of both cell lines that 
      express Vcz cytosine deaminase gene decreased by approximately 60% in the 
      presence of 5-FIC. The cytotoxic effects on cells were also induced by media 
      collected from Vcz-expressing cells pre-treated with 5-FIC. The co-injection of 
      the Vcz-transduced mesenchymal stem cells and 5-FIC have been shown to augment 
      tumor necrosis and increase longevity of tumorized mice by 50% in comparison with 
      control group animals. CONCLUSIONS: We have confirmed that the novel ICD Vcz 
      together with the non-toxic prodrug 5-FIC has a potential of being a new 
      enzyme/prodrug system for suicide gene therapy.

TI  - Circulating Short-Chain Fatty Acids Are Positively Associated with Adiposity 
      Measures in Chinese Adults.
LID - 10.3390/nu12072127 [doi]
LID - 2127
AB  - Epidemiological studies suggest a positive association between obesity and fecal 
      short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced by microbial fermentation of dietary 
      carbohydrates, while animal models suggest increased energy harvest through 
      colonic SCFA production in obesity. However, there is a lack of human 
      population-based studies with dietary intake data, plasma SCFAs, gut microbial, 
      and anthropometric data. In 490 Chinese adults aged 30-68 years, we examined the 
      associations between key plasma SCFAs (butyrate/isobutyrate, isovalerate, and 
      valerate measured by non-targeted plasma metabolomics) with body mass index (BMI) 
      using multivariable-adjusted linear regression. We then assessed whether 
      overweight (BMI ≥ 24 kg/m(2)) modified the association between dietary-precursors 
      of SCFAs (insoluble fiber, total carbohydrates, and high-fiber foods) with plasma 
      SCFAs. In a sub-sample (n = 209) with gut metagenome data, we examined the 
      association between gut microbial SCFA-producers with BMI. We found positive 
      associations between butyrate/isobutyrate and BMI (p-value < 0.05). The 
      associations between insoluble fiber and butyrate/isobutyrate differed by 
      overweight (p-value < 0.10). There was no statistical evidence for an association 
      between microbial SCFA-producers and BMI. In sum, plasma SCFAs were positively 
      associated with BMI and that the colonic fermentation of fiber may differ for 
      adults with versus without overweight.

AB  - Traditional therapy for malignant neoplasms involving surgical procedures, 
      radiotherapy and chemotherapy aims to kill neoplastic cells, but also affects 
      normal cells. Therefore, exogenous proteases are the target of studies in cancer 
      therapy, as they have been shown to be effective in suppressing tumors and 
      reducing metastases. Pluronic F127 (F127) is a copolymer of amphiphilic blocks 
      that has shown significant potential for drug administration, as it is capable of 
      incorporating hydrophobic drugs and self-assembling in micrometers of nanometric 
      size. This study investigated the effects of immobilization of the alkaline 
      protease PR4A3 with pluronic F127 micelles on the enzyme-induced cytotoxicity. 
      Protease immobilization was demonstrated through UV-visible and circular 
      dichroism (CD) spectroscopies, as the enzyme interacts with the polymeric micelle 
      of Pluronic F127 without changing its secondary structure. In addition, the 
      immobilized form of the enzyme showed greater bioavailability after passing 
      through the simulated gastrointestinal transit. Cell viability was assessed using 
      the tetrazoic methylthiazole (MTT) assay. The results open perspectives for new 
      research and development for PR4A3 in the treatment of colorectal carcinoma.

TI  - Decreased dietary fiber intake and structural alteration of gut microbiota in 
      patients with advanced colorectal adenoma.
PG  - 1044-52

AB  - BACKGROUND: Accumulating evidence indicates that diet is one of the most 
      important environmental factors involved in the progression from advanced 
      colorectal adenoma (A-CRA) to colorectal cancer. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the 
      possible effects of dietary fiber on the fecal microbiota of patients with A-CRA. 
      DESIGN: Patients with a diagnosis of A-CRA by pathological examination were 
      enrolled in the A-CRA group. Patients with no obvious abnormalities or 
      histopathological changes were enrolled in the healthy control (HC) group. 
      Dietary fiber intake was assessed in all patients. Short-chain fatty acids 
      (SCFAs) in feces were detected by gas chromatography. The fecal microbiota 
      community was analyzed by 454 pyrosequencing based on 16S ribosomal RNA. RESULTS: 
      Lower dietary fiber patterns and consistently lower SCFA production were observed 
      in the A-CRA group (n = 344). Principal component analysis showed distinct 
      differences in the fecal microbiota communities of the 2 groups. Clostridium, 
      Roseburia, and Eubacterium spp. were significantly less prevalent in the A-CRA 
      group (n = 47) than in the HC group (n = 47), whereas Enterococcus and 
      Streptococcus spp. were more prevalent in the A-CRA group (n = 47) (all P < 
      0.05). Butyrate and butyrate-producing bacteria were more prevalent in a subgroup 
      of HC subjects with a high fiber intake than in those in both the low-fiber HC 
      subgroup and the high-fiber A-CRA subgroup (all P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: A 
      high-fiber dietary pattern and subsequent consistent production of SCFAs and 
      healthy gut microbiota are associated with a reduced risk of A-CRA. This trial 
      was registered at www.chictr.org as ChiCTR-TRC-00000123.

TI  - Gut microbiota accelerate tumor growth via c-jun and STAT3 phosphorylation in 
      APCMin/+ mice.
PG  - 1231-8
LID - 10.1093/carcin/bgs137 [doi]
AB  - Chronic inflammation is increasingly recognized as a major contributor of human 
      colorectal cancer (CRC). While gut microbiota can trigger inflammation in the 
      intestinal tract, the precise signaling pathways through which host cells respond 
      to inflammatory bacterial stimulation are unclear. Here, we show that gut 
      microbiota enhances intestinal tumor load in the APC(Min/+) mouse model of CRC. 
      Furthermore, systemic anemia occurs coincident with rapid tumor growth, 
      suggesting a role for intestinal barrier damage and erythropoiesis-stimulating 
      mitogens. Short-term stimulation assays of murine colonic tumor cells reveal that 
      lipopolysaccharide, a microbial cell wall component, can accelerate cell growth 
      via a c-Jun/JNK activation pathway. Colonic tumors are also infiltrated by CD11b+ 
      myeloid cells expressing high levels of phospho-STAT3 (p-Tyr705). Our results 
      implicate the role of gut microbiota, through triggering the c-Jun/JNK and STAT3 
      signaling pathways in combination with anemia, in the acceleration of tumor 
      growth in APC(Min/+) mice.

LID - 945
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gut microbiome community composition differs between cervical cancer 
      (CC) patients and healthy controls, and increased gut diversity is associated 
      with improved outcomes after treatment. We proposed that functions of specific 
      microbial species adjoining the mucus layer may directly impact the biology of 
      CC. METHOD: Metagenomes of rectal swabs in 41 CC patients were examined by 
      whole-genome shotgun sequencing to link taxonomic structures, molecular 
      functions, and metabolic pathway to patient's clinical characteristics. RESULTS: 
      Significant association of molecular functions encoded by the metagenomes was 
      found with initial tumor size and stage. Profiling of the molecular function 
      abundances and their distributions identified 2 microbial communities co-existing 
      in each metagenome but having distinct metabolism and taxonomic structures. 
      Community A (Clostridia and Proteobacteria predominant) was characterized by high 
      activity of pathways involved in stress response, mucus glycan degradation and 
      utilization of degradation byproducts. This community was prevalent in patients 
      with larger, advanced stage tumors. Conversely, community B (Bacteroidia 
      predominant) was characterized by fast growth, active oxidative phosphorylation, 
      and production of vitamins. This community was prevalent in patients with 
      smaller, early-stage tumors. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, enrichment of mucus 
      degrading microbial communities in rectal metagenomes of CC patients was 
      associated with larger, more advanced stage tumors.

TI  - Frequent L1 retrotranspositions originating from TTC28 in colorectal cancer.
PG  - 853-9
AB  - L1 element retrotranspositions have been found to alter expression of genes 
      neighboring the insertion sites, potentially involving them in tumorigenesis and 
      tumor progression. In colorectal cancer (CRC), L1 insertions have been found to 
      target genes with a role in tumorigenesis. Structural changes such as L1 
      insertions are identifiable by whole genome sequencing (WGS). In this study, we 
      observed frequent somatic L1 retrotranspositions originating from TTC28 using 
      deep coverage WGS data from 92 CRC tumor-normal sample pairs. In two cases the 
      event had targeted NOVA1 gene (p=0.025). In addition, a germline 
      retrotransposition event from TTC28 to GABRA4 was found to be a common 
      polymorphism in the Finnish population. Thus while some events may be 
      tumorigenic, others are likely to be neutral. Our data contradict a recent study 
      where a similar signal in TTC28 was interpreted as a common inactivating 
      translocation. While much work remains to be performed to understand the 
      biological significance of retrotranspositions in cancer, accurate identification 
      of these events is a prerequisite for success.

TI  - Probiotics (Lactobacillus plantarum HNU082) Supplementation Relieves Ulcerative 
      Colitis by Affecting Intestinal Barrier Functions, Immunity-Related Gene 
      Expression, Gut Microbiota, and Metabolic Pathways in Mice.
PG  - e0165122
LID - 10.1128/spectrum.01651-22 [doi]
AB  - Probiotics can effectively improve ulcerative colitis (UC), but the mechanism is 
      still unclear. Here, shotgun metagenome and transcriptome analyses were performed 
      to explore the therapeutic effect and the mechanism of the probiotic 
      Lactobacillus plantarum HNU082 (Lp082) on UC. The results showed that Lp082 
      treatment significantly ameliorated dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced UC in 
      mice, which was manifested as increases in body weight, water intake, food 
      intake, and colon length and decreases in disease activity index (DAI), immune 
      organ index, inflammatory factors, and histopathological scores after Lp082 
      intake. An in-depth study discovered that Lp082 could improve the intestinal 
      mucosal barrier and relieve inflammation by cooptimizing the biological barrier, 
      chemical barrier, mechanical barrier, and immune barrier. Specifically, Lp082 
      rebuilt the biological barrier by regulating the intestinal microbiome and 
      increasing the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Lp082 improved the 
      chemical barrier by reducing intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and 
      vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM) and increasing goblet cells and mucin2. 
      Lp082 ameliorated the mechanical barrier by increasing zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), 
      zonula occludens-2 (ZO-2), and occludin while decreasing claudin-1 and claudin-2. 
      Lp082 optimized the immune barrier by reducing the content of interleukin-1β 
      (IL-1β), IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), myeloperoxidase (MPO), and 
      interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and increasing IL-10, transforming growth factor-β1 
      (TGF-β1), and TGF-β2, inhibiting the NF-κB signaling pathway. Taken together, 
      probiotic Lp082 can play a protective role in a DSS-induced colitis mouse model 
      by protecting the intestinal mucosal barrier, attenuating the inflammatory 
      response, and regulating microbial imbalance. This study provides support for the 
      development of probiotic-based microbial products as an alternative treatment 
      strategy for UC. IMPORTANCE Many studies have focused on the therapeutic effect 
      of probiotics on ulcerative colitis (UC), but few studies have paid attention to 
      the mechanism of probiotics, especially the therapeutic effect. This study 
      suggests that Lp082 has a therapeutic effect on colitis in mice. Its mechanisms 
      of action include protecting the mucosal barrier and actively modulating the gut 
      microbiome, modulating inflammatory pathways, and reducing neutrophil 
      infiltration. Our study enriches the mechanism and provides a new prospect for 
      probiotics in the treatment of colitis, helps to deepen the understanding of the 
      intestinal mucosal barrier, and provides guidance for the future probiotic 
      treatment of human colitis.

TI  - SMAD4 haploinsufficiency associates with augmented colonic inflammation in select 
      humans and mice.
PG  - 401-8
AB  - SMAD4 is a common mediator of the TGF-beta signaling pathway. One of the members 
      of this pathway, TGF-beta 1, has an important role in controlling gut 
      inflammation in relation to the continuous stimulation of the intestinal 
      microbiota. SMAD4 haploinsufficiency in humans has been linked to juvenile 
      polyposis hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia syndrome (JP/HHT; OMIM#17505). 
      Hematochezia and colonic mucosal inflammation suggestive of inflammatory bowel 
      diseases (IBD) have been reported in JP/HHT. Stimulated by recent experience with 
      two affected pediatric patients presented here, we explored the potential role of 
      Smad4 haploinsufficiency in a murine model of colonic inflammation. Smad4(+/-) 
      mice were maintained on a mixed C57/129SvEv background. Chronic colitis was 
      induced with repeated administration of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking 
      water. The colonic mucosal microbiota was interrogated by massively parallel 
      pyrosequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. 66.7% of Smad4(+/-) mice were 
      sensitive to DSS colitis compared to 14.3% of wild type (Chi-Square p=0.036). The 
      augmented colitis was associated with microbiota separation in the Smad4(+/-) 
      mice. Enterococcus and Enterococcus faecalis specifically was increased in 
      abundance in the colitis-prone animals. Smad4 haploinsufficiency can associate 
      with increased susceptibility to large bowel inflammation in mammals with 
      variable penetrance in association with the colonic mucosal microbiota. These 
      findings may reveal implications not only towards colonic inflammation in the 
      setting of SMAD4 haploinsufficiency, but for colorectal cancer as well.

TI  - New insights into the impact of the intestinal microbiota on health and disease: 
      a symposium report.
PG  - S1-13
LID - 10.1017/S0007114511006970 [doi]
AB  - The present report summarises key insights from a recent symposium focusing on 
      the impact of the intestinal microbiota on health and disease. A more appropriate 
      definition of health was proposed since health maintenance is a dynamic process 
      better assessed in terms of ability to adapt to stress and maintain physiological 
      homeostasis. Biomarkers specifically for health are needed; use of challenge 
      models and subjects with suboptimal health or specific disease risk were advised. 
      The complexity of interactions between external factors, the intestinal 
      epithelium, intestinal microbiota, the immune system and health was exemplified 
      by describing the effects of antibiotics, the Western diet and non-digestible 
      carbohydrates on the microbiota. The association of certain bacteria with 
      different states of health or disease was acknowledged but also that is not 
      always clear whether this is a cause or effect. Recent identification of three 
      robust faecal metagenome clusters may advance this understanding. It was 
      speculated that knowledge of the intestinal microbiota profile may eventually 
      help in the diagnosis of health risks and choice of therapy. It was agreed that 
      beneficial manipulation of the commensal microbiota can improve health outcome. 
      For this purpose, three areas were reviewed. Firstly, research into probiotics as 
      vaccine adjuvants was considered useful for substantiation of immune function 
      claims. Secondly, positive results with certain probiotics and synbiotics for 
      colorectal cancer are emerging, mostly from in vitro and animal studies. Finally, 
      studies in endurance athletes have shown strain-specific probiotic benefit in 
      terms of maintenance of immune function and, for certain strains, reduction of 
      episodes of respiratory and/or gastrointestinal tract infections.

TI  - Defining the microbial transcriptional response to colitis through integrated 
      host and microbiome profiling.
PG  - 2389-404
LID - 10.1038/ismej.2016.40 [doi]
AB  - The gut microbiome is significantly altered in inflammatory bowel diseases, but 
      the basis of these changes is not well understood. We have combined metagenomic 
      and metatranscriptomic profiling of the gut microbiome to assess modifications to 
      both bacterial community structure and transcriptional activity in a mouse model 
      of colitis. By using transcriptomic analysis of colonic tissue and luminal RNA 
      derived from the host, we have also characterised how host transcription relates 
      to the microbial transcriptional response in inflammation. In colitis, increased 
      abundance and transcription of diverse microbial gene families involved in 
      responses to nutrient deprivation, antimicrobial peptide production and oxidative 
      stress support an adaptation of multiple commensal genera to withstand a diverse 
      set of environmental stressors in the inflammatory environment. These data are 
      supported by a transcriptional signature of activated macrophages and 
      granulocytes in the gut lumen during colitis, a signature that includes the 
      transcription of the key antimicrobial genes S100a8 and S100a9 (calprotectin). 
      Genes involved in microbial resistance to oxidative stress, including 
      Dps/ferritin, Fe-dependent peroxidase and glutathione S-transferase were 
      identified as changing to a greater extent at the level of transcription than 
      would be predicted by DNA abundance changes, implicating a role for increased 
      oxygen tension and/or host-derived reactive oxygen species in driving 
      transcriptional changes in commensal microbes.

LID - 10.1038/onc.2011.545 [doi]
AB  - Colitis-associated colorectal cancers are an etiologically distinct subgroup of 
      colon cancers that occur in individuals suffering from inflammatory bowel disease 
      and arise as a consequence of persistent exposure of hyperproliferative 
      epithelial stem cells to an inflammatory microenvironment. An intrinsic defect in 
      the intestinal epithelial barrier has been proposed to be one of several factors 
      that contribute to the inappropriate immune response to the commensal microbiota 
      that underlies inflammatory bowel disease. Matriptase is a membrane-anchored 
      serine protease encoded by Suppression of Tumorigenicity-14 (ST14) that 
      strengthens the intestinal epithelial barrier by promoting tight junction 
      formation. Here, we show that intestinal epithelial-specific ablation of St14 in 
      mice causes formation of colon adenocarcinoma with very early onset and high 
      penetrance. Neoplastic progression is preceded by a chronic inflammation of the 
      colon that resembles human inflammatory bowel disease and is promoted by the 
      commensal microbiota. This study demonstrates that inflammation-associated colon 
      carcinogenesis can be initiated and promoted solely by an intrinsic intestinal 
      permeability barrier perturbation, establishes St14 as a critical 
      tumor-suppressor gene in the mouse gastrointestinal tract and adds matriptase to 
      the expanding list of pericellular proteases with tumor-suppressive functions.

AB  - Since the gut microbiota metabolizes various dietary constituents unabsorbed by 
      the small intestine and modulates colon function, it plays an essential role in 
      colon carcinogenesis. First, we have developed a model of human 
      microbiota-associated rats (HMA), fed a human-type diet and injected with 
      1-2,dimethylhydrazine (DMH). We observed that the number and size of DMH-induced 
      aberrant crypt foci (ACF) were significantly higher in HMA rats than in germ-free 
      or conventional rats. Second, we used this model to assess the protective effect 
      of an apple proanthocyanidin-rich extract (APE) on colon carcinogenesis. In this 
      model, ACF number and multiplicity were not reduced by APE at 0.001% and 0.01% in 
      drinking water. They were higher with APE 0.1% than with APE 0.01%. Therefore, 
      the cross-talk between human microbiota and the colon epithelium should be taken 
      into account in carcinogenesis models. Moreover, attention should be paid prior 
      to using proanthocyanidin extracts as dietary supplements for humans.

TI  - Metagenomic identification of gut microbiota distribution on the colonic mucosal 
      biopsy samples in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is known to be the most 
      common liver disease in the world, and there are currently no approved 
      pharmacological treatments to prevent or treat this condition. In addition to 
      being associated with an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma and 
      cirrhosis, NAFLD has now become the leading cause of liver failure-associated 
      transplantation. The 16S rRNA gene which conserved regions can serve as universal 
      primer binding sites for PCR amplification of gene fragments, while hypervariable 
      regions contain significant sequence diversity useful for prokaryotic 
      identification purposes. 16S rRNA gene sequences can be use by researchers to 
      identify prokaryotic taxonomy found in clinical samples. As a result of 
      increasing microbiota studies with developing technological developments, the 
      role of intestinal microbiota in the pathogenesis of NAFLD is revealed in an 
      important way. In this study, it was aimed to determine the clinical prognostic 
      importance of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of NAFLD and to determine the 
      microbial composition with intestinal mucosal biopsy samples in NAFLD patients. 
      MATERIAL AND METHOD: We included 20 patients diagnosed with NAFLD as a result of 
      liver function tests, histological, ultrasonographic, biopsy evidence and 20 
      normal control groups created under exclusion criteria in this study. The healthy 
      control group of the same age and gender as the patients were determined to be 
      equal, and the age, gender, BMI, insulin resistance, AST, ALT levels of the 
      individuals were recorded for analysis. İntestinal mucosal biopsy samples were 
      taken from the individuals included in the study under sterile conditions. 
      Microbial results were obtained as a result of 16S rRNA amplicon metagenomic 
      processes. The region of approximately 1500 bp covering the V1-V9 region of the 
      16S rRNA gene was targeted to detect microbial diversity. The amplified regions 
      were sequenced using next-generation sequencing. Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) 
      value was obtained with bioinformatics software with the obtained sequence data. 
      The analysis of the recorded parameters was done with the SPSS.19 statistical 
      program. RESULTS: In the designed study, 16 phyla, 28 class, 56 order, 128 
      family, 415 genera, 1041 species microorganisms were analyzed taxonomically in a 
      total of 40 individuals. In our study, Intestinal microbial diversity is lower in 
      NAFLD patients compared to control group individuals. In addition, gram-negative 
      bacteria were found to be more dominant in NAFLD patients. As a phylum, 
      Proteobacteria increased in NAFLD group, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria in 
      control group, while Firmicutes had equal distribution in both groups. BMI 
      OR = 6.37, 95 %CI (0.39-0.40) p value was 0.001 in laboratory data, whereas 
      Proteobacteria OR = 1.754, 95% CI (0.901-3.416), p value 0.05 in microbial 
      profile. CONCLUSION: The 16S rRNA metagenomic study of intestinal microbiota 
      using colonic mucosal biopsy samples in NAFLD disease was the first study in the 
      Turkish population, and important data were obtained for other studies. In the 
      data obtained, we think Proteobacteria, Ruminococcaceae, Escherichia coli and 
      Bacilli are very important in both diagnostic and treatment options as a 
      microbial profile in NAFLD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aims were to comparatively investigate the biostructure of 
      colonic microbiota in patients with neuroendocrine tumors and Crohn's disease 
      (CD) and to study the response of the microbiota to therapy. METHODS: Sections of 
      fecal cylinders from 66 patients with neuroendocrine tumors (NET; 25 foregut, 30 
      midgut, 11 hindgut), 50 patients with CD (Crohn's Disease Activity Index [CDAI] 
      ≥150), and 30 patients with chronic idiopathic diarrhea seen at the Charité 
      Hospital and 25 healthy controls were investigated using fluorescence in situ 
      hybridization with probes specific for five bacterial groups: Faecalibacterium 
      prausnitzii, Clostridium group XIVa / Roseburia group, Bacteroides, 
      Enterobacteriaceae, and Bifidobacteriaceae. RESULTS: We found a striking F. 
      prausnitzii (Fprau) depletion in the stool of patients with NET of the midgut and 
      patients with CD. The changes of the microbiota in the two other NET groups were 
      uncharacteristic and similar to those observed in patients with chronic 
      idiopathic diarrhea. Fprau depletion was reversible with chemotherapy and with 
      interferon alpha-2b treatment in patients with midgut NET. Somatostatin analogs 
      had no influence on Fprau concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with NET and CD 
      show similarities in their abnormalities of the fecal biostructure. Interferon 
      alpha and systemic chemotherapy significantly improved the fecal biostructure in 
      patients with midgut NET.

TI  - IBDsite: a Galaxy-interacting, integrative database for supporting inflammatory 
      bowel disease high throughput data analysis.
PG  - S5
LID - 10.1186/1471-2105-13-S14-S5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) refer to a group of inflammatory 
      conditions concerning colon and small intestine, which cause socially 
      uncomfortable symptoms and often are associated with an increased risk of colon 
      cancer. IBD are complex disorders, which rely on genetic susceptibility, 
      environmental factors, deregulation of the immune system, and host relationship 
      with commensal microbiota. The complexity of these pathologies makes difficult to 
      clearly understand the mechanisms of their onset. Therefore, the study of IBD 
      must be faced exploiting an integrated and multilevel approach, ranging from 
      genes, transcripts and proteins to pathways altered in affected tissues, and 
      carefully considering their regulatory mechanisms, which may intervene in the 
      pathology onset. It is also crucial to have a knowledge base about the symbiotic 
      bacteria that are hosted in the human gut. To date, much data exist regarding IBD 
      and human commensal bacteria, but this information is sparse in literature and no 
      free resource provides a homogeneously and rationally integrated view of 
      biomolecular data related to these pathologies. METHODS: Human genes altered in 
      IBD have been collected from literature, paying particular interest for the 
      immune system alterations prompted by the interaction with the gut microbiome. 
      This process has been performed manually to assure the reliability of collected 
      data. Heterogeneous metadata from different sources have been automatically 
      formatted and integrated in order to enrich information about these altered 
      genes. A user-friendly web interface has been created for easy access to 
      structured data. Tools such as gene clustering coefficients, all-pairs shortest 
      paths and pathway lengths calculation have been developed to provide data 
      analysis support. Moreover, the implemented resource is compliant to the Galaxy 
      framework, allowing the collected data to be exploited in the context of high 
      throughput bioinformatics analysis. RESULTS: To fill the lack of a reference 
      resource for 'omics' science analysis in the context of IBD, we developed the 
      IBDsite (available at http://www.itb.cnr.it/ibd), a disease-oriented platform, 
      which collects data related to biomolecular mechanisms involved in the IBD onset. 
      The resource provides a section devoted to human genes identified as altered in 
      IBD, which can be queried at different biomolecular levels and visualised in 
      gene-centred report pages. Furthermore, the system presents information related 
      to the gut microbiota involved in IBD affected patients. The IBDsite is compliant 
      with all Galaxy installations (in particular, it can be accessed from our custom 
      version of Galaxy, http://www.itb.cnr.it/galaxy), in order to facilitate 
      high-throughput data integration and to enable evaluations of the genomic basis 
      of these diseases, complementing the tools embedded in the IBDsite. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Lots of sparse data exist concerning IBD studies, but no on-line resource 
      homogeneously and rationally integrate and collect them. The IBDsite is an 
      attempt to group available information regarding human genes and microbial 
      aspects related to IBD, by means of a multilevel mining tool. Moreover, it 
      constitutes a knowledge base to filter, annotate and understand new experimental 
      data in order to formulate new scientific hypotheses, thanks to the possibility 
      of integrating genomics aspects by employing the Galaxy framework. Discussed 
      use-cases demonstrate that the developed system is useful to infer not trivial 
      knowledge from the existing widespread data or from novel experiments.

TI  - Butyl-fructooligosaccharides modulate gut microbiota in healthy mice and 
      ameliorate ulcerative colitis in a DSS-induced model.
PG  - 1834-1845
LID - 10.1039/d1fo03337a [doi]
AB  - Butyl-fructooligosaccharides (B-FOSs) are newly synthesized prebiotics composed 
      of short-chain FOS (GF2, 1-kestose; GF3, nystose; GF4, fructofuranosyl-nystose; 
      GF5, 1-F-(1-b-D-fructofuranosyl)-2-nystose) bound with one or two butyric groups 
      by ester bonds. Previous in vitro studies have shown that B-FOS treatment 
      increases butyrate production and protects the growth of butyrate-producing 
      bacteria during fermentation. The aim of this study was to further test B-FOS as 
      a novel prebiotic compound by evaluating the effect of B-FOS on gut microbiota 
      via 16S rRNA metagenomic analysis in an Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mouse 
      model and examining its anti-inflammatory efficacy in a mouse model of colitis 
      induced by dextran sodium sulphate (DSS). In the healthy ICR mouse study, linear 
      discriminant analysis effect size results revealed that Bifidobacterium was the 
      representative phylotype in the B-FOS treatment compared to the control group. 
      Furthermore, the cecal butyrate concentration of the B-FOS group was 
      significantly higher than that of the control (P < 0.05). The high concentration 
      of butyrate in the B-FOS treatment was probably associated with the high relative 
      abundance of clusters of orthologous group (COG) 4770 (acetyl/propionyl-CoA 
      carboxylase). In the DSS-induced infection study, B-FOS significantly ameliorated 
      the symptoms of DSS-induced colitis, increased the mRNA expression of occludin, 
      decreased tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and interleukin 
      (IL-8) in the colon tissues, and significantly increased cecal butyrate 
      concentrations. These findings suggest that B-FOS ameliorated DSS-induced colitis 
      by maintaining the epithelial barrier and reducing the secretion of inflammation 
      related cytokines.

TI  - Gut Prevotella as a possible biomarker of diet and its eubiotic versus dysbiotic 
      roles: a comprehensive literature review.
PG  - 131-140
LID - 10.1017/S0007114519000680 [doi]
AB  - The gut microbiota has a profound impact on human health. Emerging data show that 
      dietary patterns are associated with different communities of bacterial species 
      within the gut. Prevotella species have been correlated with plant-rich diets, 
      abundant in carbohydrates and fibres. Dysbiosis within the gut ecosystem has been 
      associated with the development of non-communicable diseases such as obesity, the 
      metabolic syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, 
      colorectal cancer, type 1 diabetes, allergies and other diseases. The purpose of 
      this comprehensive literature review was to evaluate the available data on the 
      impact of diet on the Prevotella genus, as a dietary fibre fermenter in the gut 
      as well as its implications as a potential biomarker for homeostasis or disease 
      state through its metabolite signature. Studies were identified by conducting 
      PubMed, Web of Science Core Collection and Google Scholar electronic searches. We 
      found eighty-five publications reporting the impact of dietary patterns on gut 
      microbial communities, including Prevotella or Prevotella/Bacteroides ratio in 
      particular. Moreover, the role of Prevotella species on health status was also 
      evaluated. Prevotella possess a high genetic diversity, representing one of the 
      important groups found in the oral cavity and large intestine of man. The gut 
      commensal Prevotella bacteria contribute to polysaccharide breakdown, being 
      dominant colonisers of agrarian societies. However, studies also suggested a 
      potential role of Prevotella species as intestinal pathobionts. Further 
      metagenomic studies are needed in order to reveal health- or disease-modulating 
      properties of Prevotella species in the gut.

TI  - Review Article: The Role of Molecular Pathological Epidemiology in the Study of 
      Neoplastic and Non-neoplastic Diseases in the Era of Precision Medicine.
PG  - 602-11
LID - 10.1097/EDE.0000000000000471 [doi]
AB  - Molecular pathology diagnostics to subclassify diseases based on pathogenesis are 
      increasingly common in clinical translational medicine. Molecular pathological 
      epidemiology (MPE) is an integrative transdisciplinary science based on the 
      unique disease principle and the disease continuum theory. While it has been most 
      commonly applied to research on breast, lung, and colorectal cancers, MPE can 
      investigate etiologic heterogeneity in non-neoplastic diseases, such as 
      cardiovascular diseases, obesity, diabetes mellitus, drug toxicity, and 
      immunity-related and infectious diseases. This science can enhance causal 
      inference by linking putative etiologic factors to specific molecular biomarkers 
      as outcomes. Technological advances increasingly enable analyses of various 
      -omics, including genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, 
      metabolomics, metagenomics, microbiome, immunomics, interactomics, etc. 
      Challenges in MPE include sample size limitations (depending on availability of 
      biospecimens or biomedical/radiological imaging), need for rigorous validation of 
      molecular assays and study findings, and paucities of interdisciplinary experts, 
      education programs, international forums, and standardized guidelines. To address 
      these challenges, there are ongoing efforts such as multidisciplinary consortium 
      pooling projects, the International Molecular Pathological Epidemiology Meeting 
      Series, and the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in 
      Epidemiology-MPE guideline project. Efforts should be made to build biorepository 
      and biobank networks, and worldwide population-based MPE databases. These 
      activities match with the purposes of the Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K), Genetic 
      Associations and Mechanisms in Oncology (GAME-ON), and Precision Medicine 
      Initiatives of the United States National Institute of Health. Given advances in 
      biotechnology, bioinformatics, and computational/systems biology, there are wide 
      open opportunities in MPE to contribute to public health.

TI  - The effect of probiotics on faecal microbiota and genotoxic activity of faecal 
      water in patients with atopic dermatitis: a randomized, placebo-controlled study.
PG  - 22-9
LID - 10.1016/j.clnu.2011.08.012 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Colonic microbiota is involved in the etiology of colon cancer 
      according to several reports. Studies also indicate that the microbiota differs 
      between atopic patients and healthy subjects. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether a 
      probiotic mix containing Lactobacillus paracasei Lpc-37, Lactobacillus 
      acidophilus 74-2, and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis DGCC 420 can affect 
      the microbiota and its genotoxic activity in healthy subjects and patients with 
      atopic dermatitis (AD). METHODS: A placebo-controlled cross-over study was 
      conducted. Fifteen healthy adults and 15 adult AD patients consumed 2×100 ml/d of 
      either a probiotic or a placebo drink for 8 weeks followed by a wash out period 
      of 2 weeks before crossing the intervention. Faecal water was isolated from stool 
      samples collected at the end of each period. HT29c19a cells incubated with faecal 
      water were measured for DNA damage using single-cell gel electrophoresis ("comet 
      assay"). Bacterial species were determined by qPCR and concentrations of 
      short-chain fatty acids were measured by means of gas chromatography. RESULTS: 
      Probiotic supplementation resulted in a significant increase in lactobacilli, 
      whereas numbers of Bifidobacteria and Bacteroidetes remained unchanged. 
      Clostridium perfringens cluster I-II was significantly reduced in healthy 
      subjects. Genotoxic potential (expressed as tail intensity) of faecal water, was 
      not affected. However, tail intensity decreased significantly in the probiotic 
      period compared to placebo (23.5 vs. 16.7%) in AD patients. Although faecal 
      concentrations of short-chain fatty acids were not affected, faecal pH was 
      significantly reduced (7.0 vs. 6.6) in AD patients after probiotics. CONCLUSION: 
      The results indicate that probiotics lower the genotoxic potential of faecal 
      water in AD patients. The faecal C. perfringens cluster I-II levels remained 
      unaffected suggesting either a change in their activity, or the fact that other 
      bacterial species are responsible for the reduced genotoxic activity of faecal 
      water.

AB  - The human intestine is a balanced ecosystem well suited for bacterial survival, 
      colonization and growth, which has evolved to be beneficial both for the host and 
      the commensal bacteria. Here, we investigated the effect of bacterial metabolites 
      produced by commensal bacteria on AP-1 signaling pathway, which has a plethora of 
      effects on host physiology. Using intestinal epithelial cell lines, HT-29 and 
      Caco-2, stably transfected with AP-1-dependent luciferase reporter gene, we 
      tested the effect of culture supernatant from 49 commensal strains. We observed 
      that several bacteria were able to activate the AP-1 pathway and this was 
      correlated to the amount of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced. Besides 
      being a major source of energy for epithelial cells, SCFAs have been shown to 
      regulate several signaling pathways in these cells. We show that propionate and 
      butyrate are potent activators of the AP-1 pathway, butyrate being the more 
      efficient of the two. We also observed a strong synergistic activation of AP-1 
      pathway when using butyrate with PMA, a PKC activator. Moreover, butyrate 
      enhanced the PMA-induced expression of c-fos and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, but not 
      p38 and JNK. In conclusion, we showed that SCFAs especially butyrate regulate the 
      AP-1 signaling pathway, a feature that may contribute to the physiological impact 
      of the gut microbiota on the host. Our results provide support for the 
      involvement of butyrate in modulating the action of PKC in colon cancer cells.

TI  - A diet based on cured acorn-fed ham with oleic acid content promotes 
      anti-inflammatory gut microbiota and prevents ulcerative colitis in an animal 
      model.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diets based on meat products are not recommended in the case of 
      ulcerative colitis (UC). The objective here is to test if some traditional cured 
      meat products, as acorn-fed ham (high levels of oleic acid), may be useful for 
      controlling inflammatory diseases as UC in animal models, which could represent a 
      new dietary complementary intervention in the prevention of this inflammatory 
      disease in humans. METHODS: Two rat cohorts have been used: conventional 
      vegetable rat feed and acorn-fed ham. UC was induced with DSS in drinking water 
      ad libitum for 1 week. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and 16S rRNA metagenomics 
      from bacterial populations were analyzed in cecum samples. Colon samples were 
      analyzed for histological parameters. RESULTS: Acorn-fed ham diet induced changes 
      in gut microbiota composition, with pronounced enrichments in anti-inflammatory 
      bacterial genera (Alistipes, Blautia, Dorea, Parabacteroides). The animals with 
      this diet showed a strong reduction in most parameters associated to ulcerative 
      colitis: disease activity index, macroscopic score of colitis, epitelium 
      alteration in colon mucosa, inflammatory cell density in colon, myeloperoxidase 
      titers in colon, proinflammatory cytokines (IL-17, IFN-γ). Also, acorn-fed ham 
      diet animals showed increased total antioxidant activity an oleic acid levels in 
      plasma, as well as higher short-chain fatty acid concentrations in cecum 
      (isobutyric, isovaleric and valeric). CONCLUSIONS: In the acorn-fed ham cohort, 
      as a result of the dietary intake of oleic acid and low intake of omega-6 fatty 
      acids, a strong preventive effect against UC symptoms was observed.

AB  - Candida auris is an emerging multidrug-resistant yeast with high mortality. We 
      report the sentinel C. auris case on the United States West Coast in a patient 
      who relocated from India. We identified close phylogenetic relatedness to the 
      South Asia clade and ERG11 Y132F and FKS1 S639Y mutations potentially explaining 
      antifungal resistance.
